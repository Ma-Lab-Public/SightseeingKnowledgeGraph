Brandon Zoras,2016-08-08 02:27:56,5,2,For 300 yen to enter it was really nice. You get an incense to place down. The giant Buddha is really nice and there are a lot of small buildings around. You can go inside the main temple from the stairs at the back to see a lot more statues/icons. To the back right side there is a world war 2 memorial as well for the unknown solider and it has names of lots of other country's soldiers who passed during the war. There is also containers of sand from the different countries involved in the war. A nice place to see.,no,,view review

In addition to the gigantic statue there are other, really meaningful shrines. On paying to enter you‚Äôre given a stick of incense and told it‚Äôs in remembrance of the unknown soldiers of WWII that gave their lives. I usually associate these thoughts with the Allies.  My Dad, who was in the army aged 17-65 died a few years ago. I was overcome and couldn‚Äôt stop weeping. I found a place of quiet contemplation, a shrine to unborn babies - cue more weeping. Then the memorial hall for the unknown soldier. It‚Äôs an active Buddhist monastery, and felt special and unique in the somewhat gauzy Disney culture of Kyoto. Come.

I paid respect to the Buddhist monument in Kyoto, Ryozen, a dedication for the unknown dead Japanese soldiers of World War II.

I witnessed a ceremony, one of the participant's eyes met mine and a palpable unknown recognition quickly arose between us for a few seconds, as if she unexplainably knew exactly who I and my family were.

When leaving, a buddhist monk scurringly passed by me, his eyes briefly meeting my eyes, before quickly glancing down while leaning his body and pulling his clothing away from me as in fear of a plague, when passing me.

I have no clue why.

I don't think I will forget that moment ever.

A statue of Kannon in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City, erected in 1955 by Hirosuke Ishikawa, the founder of the Teisan Group, to commemorate the war dead and victims of World War II. It is 24m high, weighs about 500t, and is made of steel concrete. It is operated by the religious corporation Ryozen Kannon Church. Below the statue of Kannon, there is a sanctuary where the principal image of the Kannon, the Eleven-Faced Kannon, is enshrined. In the memorial hall, there is a monument to the world's unknown soldier, and four memorial services are held each day. Betsuin includes Tokyo Betsuin Tokujiji and Akasaka Betsuin.

I told him that I would be visiting in 5 minutes, and he lit a thick incense stick. Hurry up to the front of the main hall and put your hands together. The 11-faced Kannon, the main deity, cannot be seen even if you look into it.

When I read the pamphlet later, I found out that it was written as a martyr's spirit, and as a prayer for the souls of those who died in the war and the victims of the war. It was erected.

He is said to be the founder of Teisan, and he is the chairman of Mutual Taxi (Buddhist Buddha statue at 15m on Route 9).

Y C,2023-02-01 14:39:19,5,2," On the way from Yasaka Shrine to Kiyomizu Temple, I happened to pass by here and was attracted by the huge Guanyin statue, so I bought a ticket to enter.
The entire park of Lingshan Guanyin is located at the foot of Dongshan Mountain. It is mainly composed of the statue of Guanyin, the mirror pond, the wish-fulfilling jewel, the Buddha's foot stone, the flower tomb, the hall of Aizen Mingwang, the twelve zodiac deities, the gomo hall, the lotus hall, the monument to the unknown soldier of World War II, and the stillborn child site. It is composed of Tibetan Zun and Chaojing Hall.

Lingshan Avalokitesvara Statue: Built in 1955 by the founder of the Disan Group to commemorate the fallen soldiers and victims of World War II, with the image of ""Avalokitesvara in white"" as the image, the statue is solemn. The Guanyin statue is 24 meters high and weighs about 500 tons. It is a reinforced concrete structure. Below the Kannon statue is a shrine enshrining the main image of the eleven-faced Kannon.

Ruyi Orb: Also called the Wishing Orb, in front of Guanyin's right hand, it is a place where wishes can come true! It is said that touching the wishful jewel with the right hand, and at the same time recite the wish silently in the heart, while turning the wishful jewel three times clockwise, then the wish will come true! According to the introduction, Lingshan Guanyin is located in a place of geomantic omen, and it has been known to the public as an auspicious place since ancient times. In the Heian period, it was a holy place where the secret treasure of esoteric Buddhism, ""Nengzuu Cintama"", was buried.

Hall of King Aidanming: King Aidanming is the king of esoteric Buddhism, who lives in the samadhi of great love and greed. After Esoteric Buddhism spread to Japan, Dongmi (Japanese Esoteric Buddhism) derived the meaning of ""love, good marriage, and happy family"". Therefore, Lord Aizenmei became the god of love in Japan. Therefore, this place has also become a holy place to pray for a good relationship and a happy family.

Monument to the Unknown Soldier of World War II: Supported by the heroic spirits of the unknown soldiers from all over the world (not limited to Japan) who died for their country in World War II, it is said that four memorial services are held every day.
Zodiac deities guard: Located in the body of Guanyin Bodhisattva, there are deities that protect each zodiac. You can visit according to your zodiac sign.

Buddha's foot stone: The footprint is very huge, which is a symbol of Sakyamuni. It is carved side by side in the shape of Buddha's right and left footprints. The rock is five meters long and two meters six wide.

Stillborn child Jizang Zun: A special prayer place for the little lives who died young, praying that the souls of the water children who could not enjoy the heavenly life can rest in peace in a peaceful and peaceful environment. It is the beauty of Japan to have such a dedicated place to pray for children who have died.

Flower Tomb: Located in a small corner of the garden with verdant trees, there is a monument standing, quiet and serene, with a burst of red, quite Zen-like.

Tickets: 300 yen
Visiting time: 8:40-16:20 (stop selling tickets at 16:00)

This place is quieter and have lesser tourists compared to the other famous spots in Kyoto. Once we entered the temple (required entrance fees), we saw a beautifully built statue, magnificently large and  eye catching. The place is calm and soothing. If you happened to be around the area, do stop by.
