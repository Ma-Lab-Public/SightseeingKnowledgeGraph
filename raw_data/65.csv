Chihiro Kato,2017-01-24 12:10:11,5,0,"I joined evening tea party here. It costs ¥6000 per person but worth joining. Dim sum (dinner) and tea/coffee are included. They serve authentic matcha as well, which has deep bitter taste. We could see beautiful pond which reflects trees like mirror in the evening. It was very interesting to see. Walking in this season is so tough as it is very freezing. You should wear thick coat. Walking with guide here is enjoyable.

It was so beautiful that it was almost magical. There was also a light composed performance that brought both traditional and modern side of Japan.

There was also a tea room that requires additional fee. You will be served with bitter green tea and a piece of sweet mochi.

The gardens were lit so beautifully and the temples were fantastic. They had a 3D mapped light show in one of their gardens and it was excellent. The highlight of the visit for me was definitely the pond which reflected the illuminated trees. It was so still it was like a mirror. I definitely had a zen moment standing their in awe of its beauty.

The gardens are lovely and have a few wooden bridges and the trees around the lake caused a lovely reflection in the lake like glass. Fantastic picture taking opportunity.

Neat 3D show. There is also a smal bamboo forest here which is really cool lit up at night. Almost as nice as the ones in Arashiyama and less crowded.

Kodai ji is one of most beautiful things I saw in Japan.

Ricky K.M. LAI,2018-05-01 13:40:14,5,2,"We didn’t plan to visit this temple but only because it was opened in the evening during the cherry blossom week for special viewing.  It was rather different to visit a temple at night but the place is well prepared, it is a well signed walking tour and seeing the cherry blossom, I.e. Sakura is very different experience. The tree in front of the main hall is fully blossom and the pink flowers were breathtaking.  Highly recommended if you will be in Kyoto during spring time.

Cost very reasonable and the overall garden quite beautiful with many Japanese maples.

With so many beautiful temples and shrines in the that can be visited for free, it was hard for us to rationalize paying to visit this particular one.

Still, I think its still worth it for the experience. Within walking distance of other many other famous temples with night illuminations, so its possible to see multiple in one evening.

I have to admit there is not a lot to see overall so if you want more indepth information i recommend going somewhere else - 600¥ is also a bit higher than usual but if you want to take a break of crowded kyoto thats the place!
Good sanitary facilities and a small teahouse with the typical green tea and sweets at the end.
The small shrine in front is also worth visiting with a very nice stairway from the streets from kyoto and a small ice cream booth (matcha ice is recommended). the surroundings are also worth checking out with another nice buddhist temple and traditional vendor's streets close by.

They prepared a little tour around the area, leading through a little bamboo forrest where u can take good pictures at. It's right at the side to the traditional district which also spreads a calming atmosphere. A good place to go to for a relaxing walk and sightseeing.
