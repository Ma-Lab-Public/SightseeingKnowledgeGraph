Shingo Sae-Lim,2021-12-04 03:55:55,3,2,"(Trip was made back then on 3 Dec 2019, 2 years before the Covid-19 Pandemic hit)

Kinkakuji is actually located quite out of the way just north of Kyoto city and would take probably an hour to get to depending from where you’re at.

I admit that it’s a dazzlingly brilliant looking temple, but apart from admiring the picturesque view of the striking golden temple overlooking the pond, there really isn’t much else to see or do here.

You might also have to jostle with the other tourists to just have a good view or snap a decent photo as it’s extremely touristy. You can’t tell from the photos but it’s also very noisy due to the crowd which kinda ruined the ambience.

It’s one of those attractions which you can strike off from your bucket list once you’re done.

Arifa Jannat,2021-12-11 13:57:43,4,8,"One of the most famous spots in Kyoto, temple of the Golden pavilion. Actually, it’s a Buddhist temple which is covered with golden leaf giving an iconic mirror view. Usually, the area is crowded and I recommend you to go there early morning. You can enjoy a relaxing walk through the wayside. The entrance fee is 400 yen.For road direction, both English and Japanese language are indicated. Highly recommended this place for people who like traditional and historical view.

Robert T,2022-02-06 01:07:53,3,17,"Well, what can you say that hasn’t already been said about this iconic Japanese landmark? Everyone has to tick it off the Japan ‘to do; ‘ list. Personally, I think it is overrated in terms of both historical significance and the beauty of its surroundings. There are far better gardens to be seen in Japan. It is however striking, and to be seen at least once. The gold has both spiritual meaning (purity) but was probably also a product of the ego of its previous owners. A somewhat ostentatious status symbol, if you like. As with many temples, it has been burnt down and rebuilt a few times, which explains its ‘current newish’ look. The Phoenix atop the roof is believed to be original, and is a symbol of divine favour, virtue, and harmony. Within the complex bit of fun can be had watching people attempting to throw coins into a well hole placed at a distance from the throwing spot. Give it a go – it might bring you luck! Don’t miss the 600 year old pine planted by a previous shogun (ancient ruler of Japan). It is shaped as a boat and is a metaphor for passage to the Pure Land following death. On a cheerier note, I include in the pictures some of the admonishing posters you see around Kyoto giving guidance on appropriate behaviour…

You have buy a ticket of 400yen to enter.
The ticket price is not worth to be have 400yen.
Due to its beauty,historical image, price should be high.
The iconic golden temple of Japan is also one of the oldest temple.
The golden color is very fascinating.
Always crowded so its very difficult to get a good picture.
Located in a very peaceful environment.
One of the masterpiece of Japan's Historical Culture.

Shahadat H. Rakib,2022-02-20 12:26:38,5,1,"Kinkakuji is perhaps the most well-known temple in Japan. The pavilion itself is a three-story structure, the top two floors of which are entirely covered in gold leaf and shimmers in front of a pond. Visitors are not allowed to enter the actual building, but can view the pavillion from various angles as they follow the path around from the entrance. I recommend to get there early. We took bus 12 and arrived just before opening at 9am. Due to Covid, there were less visitors so there were plenty of photo opportunities without the crowds. With such a calm, sunny day, the reflection on the water was spectacular. This was a highlight for our trip and a must to see when in Kyoto.

Richard Wu,2022-08-06 18:56:17,5,0,"One of the most popular spot for everyone. Transportation is not easy and we don’t know how to take the bus and how often the bus is. I guess due to the la huge barrier. Taxi is another option but we chose not to.

We got here and as expected, there are so many people here already. The most iconic gold temple is inside that you cannot see directly from the entrance or outside.

Japanese serenity and garden design is really impressive. The noise comes from visitors, Japanese are still quiet and civilized anywhere they go.

There are so many better photos of this temple and I decided not to take it. My iPhone cannot compete with professional cameras.

You don’t have to be a Buddhist to come. Come and be amazed by Japanese architecture and maintenance. You will be impressed.

Kinkaku-ji - the golden pavilion. It does exactly what it says on the tin! The shiny gold tin.

I think the best time to visit is around 3-30pm - 4-00pm as the sun looms low whilst it considers setting. It's always crowded here so arrive with patience as your ally. Then, when it's your turn - line up those photos you've been thinking about, reel off half a dozen like you are the paparazzi, then get out of the way so that someone else can have a go!

I usually don't spend too much time here. Once the initial front shot is taken I'll wander around and find some other interesting vantages - fire off a few more shots, then jet!

Once outside it can be a bit confusing about what to do next. As this is usually at the tail-end of the day I'm inclined to head back to the hotel for a freshen up before dinner and cocktails. If you are pondering on doing something similar, there is a taxi stand right near the entrance, past the traffic lights and you can make your stealthy getaway there!

climbbmilc93,2023-04-11 13:09:56,5,0,"Loved our time visiting here.

The layout is a probably a 1km loop through the gardens. Beautifully kept grounds. Only advice is to get here earlier to avoid the large crowds which pickup around 1pm.

Entrance was ¥500pp
Lots of toilet facilities and touristy gift shops.

iris soh,2023-04-14 21:09:38,4,0,"Beautiful golden building. Very touristy it was packed with tourist and hard to find spot to take photos. Because everyone is moving down the tour line, you feel you should keep moving too. It was hard to just stop when you wanted to stop. The small paths of the garden are closed off to the tourist, they keeps watch, which I understand. The whole thing takes less than an hour to finish. It's a good thing to check out if you have time but not a must-see place.

Peter Snow,2023-04-15 03:13:18,5,0,"Another must see Kyoto site. Just be prepared for crowds. If you can visit very early or an hour before closing time. If you are lucky with the weather the temple reflects on the water. Should take about an hour to go around, access via bus or taxi.

David Nguyen,2023-04-16 08:30:21,5,0,"Kinkakuji is the real golden covered temple. You could only take photographs the tenple from the distance as its surrounding ponds. They just open the temples in some special occasions in the year so hardly for tourist to come inside. The temple used to owned by a rich landlord and it become a temple following his last wish before he’s dead.

Note Book,2023-04-17 00:27:40,5,1,"It's literally so beautiful! The lakes and trees are beautiful, and the building is certainly beautiful. We went during the spring so it's obviously very stunning, but they had pictures of it in the winter and it still looks beautiful. There are some places where pictures aren't allowed, so it's good to be reminded of that to respect culture and history.

Jenny Nguyen,2023-04-18 17:30:59,5,0,"Kinkaku-ji, also known as the Temple of the Golden Pavilion, is a must-visit destination in Kyoto, Japan. As soon as you set foot in the temple's grounds, you are immediately captivated by the sheer beauty and serenity of this iconic site.

Built from wood and coated in gold the look of the shrine is historic yet fresh and iconic. If you can try to toss a coin to one of the little spots placed by the path after the shrine for good luck

Diana D,2023-04-20 05:58:42,5,0,"Beautiful temple, well preserved and when the weather is good its the best time to go! Especially early in the morning. I would recommend taking the walk slow once you are in, as the area is small but there is a lot to see!

Peter Lagomarsino,2023-04-20 13:23:19,3,1,"This is a beautiful temple to see and well worth the visit. Much like the Miyajima Grand Tori Gate, I recommend finding a time that is not popular. The paths are too small, and if it's raining there are so many eye poking umbrellas that it's not very pleasant. Way too many buses of people punching and shoving their way to the fence for that coveted shot. If it weren't so crowded, even on a rainy day this would be great, You can bring the zen to the shrine, but they can't deliver it to you with so much chaos. Still it's a beautiful garden, pond and shrine. At 700 million yen to rebuild it after it burned, it should be limited so there is not so much competition from very rude tourists. Try to pick a time that it's not crowded like a weekday.

Mary Hutching,2023-04-21 23:58:36,2,0,"This place was chocka full of people - god knows why. There are so many other interesting temples and shrines out there. I only went because it was part of a bike tour - I could happily have skipped it. If you enjoy long queues and busloads of temple, go visit. If not, avoid it. The garden is very zen - focusing on the shape of the trees rather than plantings. It's probably very pretty in the autumn, but so are plenty of other gardens.

Kyle Woofter,2023-05-02 15:02:07,5,1,"This beautiful and ancient temple is filled with Japanese history as a world heritage site and one of the most popular attractions in Kyoto. Not only is the temple breathtaking, but the surrounding gardens and forests are immaculately maintained.   When we went, there were multiple school groups and organized guided tours there as well. Organized tour groups can be bothersome due to their size, but it's not difficult to stand aside and wait for a moment as they pass.

Philip Nalangan,2023-05-07 04:18:16,2,0,"Beautiful golden temple, but very crowded. It feels like we are in a zoo; the crowd goes around the temple to take their photos then move away so others can have their turn. Spend at least 1 hour to see the entire temple compound.

Jerry is Black,2023-05-09 07:36:32,4,0,"It took us less than 15 minutes to walk around the place, take pictures, and eat ice cream at the end of the trail. There's nothing much to do but to be enchanted by this Golden Temple. You can't go near or enter the temple, just a few distance away for picture taking. Good for studying and understanding the Japanese culture. 💪😎

It was a bit crowded, so expect to wait for picture opportunities. However, this did not detract from the overall experience, I quite enjoyed my time here.

Jasmin Haugstuen P,2023-05-18 14:56:11,5,1,"This was a definite highlight of our Kyoto trip. A 400 yen entrance fee, a rather crowded day, (we came afternoon - go early if you can to avoid this) and we still got our breath taken away by this beautiful golden sight. It felt almost like the feeling you get when you see one of the wonders of the world. Other worldly, goddess like, beautiful , spiritual - simply stunning. Out of all the places I visited in Japan this was the place I felt I needed to purchase something to commemorate my visit, a beautiful framed photo of it. Definitely a must see!

Félix Potvin (ブラミ),2023-05-19 22:48:13,5,0,"A must see if you are in the area. It is one of the iconic temples of Kyoto for a reason.

The gold layers on the structure gives it a powerful aura. Make sure to read the pamphlet to learn a bit more about this place!

The gardens are not that special in my opinion, but they definitely still enjoyable to walk along.

There are steps on the way out, however I am sure you can request to exit the same way if you are on wheelchair or unable to climb stairs.

Aaron Saldana,2023-05-25 03:07:58,5,0,"An amazing site for locals and tourists. You'll certainly have pockets of people you'll need to swim through occasionally, almost always around photo spots. If you can arrive early enough to see the sunrise reflecting off of the temple itself, even better. Kyoto is known for their macha and tofu. Cross off the Macha from your list with the tea ceremony at the end along with any of the delicious varieties of treats they have near the end of the trail.

Tihomira Parichkova,2023-05-28 03:35:50,5,1,"One of the places that cannot be forgotten.
The golden Buddhist temple was built more than 500 years ago.

Peaceful with green trees and a pond right in front of the temple itself, it is picturesque.

We visited it during the weekend ( Sunday ) and there were a lot of people - both tourists and students.

The ticket for adults was 500 Japanese yens and it did not take us a long time to wait in the queue in order to buy it.

Sander van Vliet,2023-06-04 06:00:52,4,1,"A very impressive temple covered in gold leaf. I wonder if the gold leaf is coming from the Kanazawa area 🤔? There is not much more to say, looking at the number of reviews. The route through the garden is predefined and has to be followed. Even though it can be really busy, if you take your time and you are patient you can make some nice pics. With so many customers I guess they make enough income to keep the temple well maintained. It will take you a good half an hour to make it through the complete garden
