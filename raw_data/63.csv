Kellie Lutze,2017-02-06 14:56:49,5,2,"A beautiful park with busy touristy areas and a quiet places for all people. A good range of trees, water features and walkways make this a good use of green space that can be used to get out of the hustle and bustle and relax by yourself, with friends or someone special.

Temples can also be found in this park for additional cultural value.

Quite a climb to get to the top, but there's a slope on the slide that makes the journey easier.

Once you're up, you're rewarded with quiet views of various temples.

Valdas,2018-06-06 09:44:08,3,0,"Unfortunately I visited this park while it was raining and also while there was a lot of construction and maintenance work being done on the various temples in the park which effected my opinion of the place somewhat. The park is generally well maintained and clean and the various ponds, trees and most importantly temples are great to see. I am told this park is most beautiful during the cherry blossom season but it's a shame you cant experience that outside the specific blooming season. Unfortunately this park has clearly become a major tourist attraction as there are various snack, drink and souvenir shops scattered around the park in addition to vending machines and many tourists visit this place as it even has its own dedicated tour bus parking. This has somewhat over commercialised the park which has resulted in it losing some of its charm and despite having many temples and shrines it's not quite a tranquil experience. While this is not one of the best parks I've been to in Japan I still think if you are in the area the park and temples are worth a visit. Also, FYI the park has a number of public restrooms without an enterence fee, and also keep in mind photography is not allowed at the enterence of many of the shrines in this park.

I was lucky to be there during the peak of the blooming season where the whole area is brightened with fabulous white and pink flowers. I am very delighted to visit here, and I enjoyed the atmosphere so much.
There are plenty of food and drink stalls where we can buy snacks and drinks, grab a mat and start picnic under the blooming sakura trees. We can burrow mats for free of cost and it is great compliments for the travelers.

Shingo Sae-Lim,2021-12-01 13:10:12,3,1,"(Trip was made back then on 1 Dec 2019, 2 years before the Covid-19 Pandemic hit)

Maruyama Park is Kyoto’s most popular spot for cherry blossom viewing during spring time. But they said that it also offers a beautiful view of the trees changing colours in autumn.

However, by the time we arrived in Kyoto on 1 Dec 2019, either most of the trees have shed their autumn leaves (it was the last few days of autumn season), or majority of the tree species were not predominantly not intended for autumn foliage.

So it was rather unfortunate that the view wasn’t as impressive as some of the other places we’ve seen on the trip.

Nevertheless, I’m sure the park would look spectacular when the cherry blossoms bloom in spring as majority of the trees in the park are cherry blossom trees.

Still a beautiful park to take a stroll in autumn and it’s just next to Chionin and Shorenin Temple which are worth exploring.

Took photos with a friend and there was many different places within the park that had a different background. The nature was well kept and the temple is maintained. A couple of shops that offer sweets.

We went on a rainy day so it wasn't crowded (cherry blossom season).
