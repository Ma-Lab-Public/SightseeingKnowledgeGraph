Ayk HH,2017-01-12 06:20:04,4,1,"For Japanese histric movie or drama fans, this is the legendary place. My recommendation is enjoy the location sets that we are able to walk through and touch, Edo era style streets. For the option there are ninja attractions, characters, more and more. For the 1day kyoto pass holder discount is available so check thr info before pay. Closing hour is pretty early so better ti aware. Last time of in is before an hour of closing.

Maharani Wanodya A.P.,2018-07-02 13:03:57,5,1,"This theme park offers an amazing replica of classic Japan. The traditional houses, train, even the household items like wooden shelves and stoves. So many Instagrammable spots, including Yoshiwara district where visitors can pose like geisha complete with the properties. Not all of the attractions are included in the JPY 2,200 entrance fee. Some attractions need additional fee (JPY 500 each). If you don't want to pay more, you can still enjoy the free shows like ninja-themed comedy show, re-enactment of old Japan's customary, and behind the scene of Japan's historical drama.

You can rent a samurai or a ninja costume and go around the scenes where famous movies were/are filmed.
Renting is quite expensive, but it’s worthy. The best samurai armor costume is around 11K¥ for the whole day, but you will look epic in it :).

We went there on 13 May 2019 and it was so hot there in the outdoor area.

Tess Löwenhardt,2019-06-04 08:03:08,4,2,"An interesting and pretty place but know you'll have to pay extra to customise your experience.
It's a bit annoying but if you think about it, of they didn't do it this way, all shows would be packed, long lines and much more expensive tickets.
We went on a week day and it was relaxed and quiet enough. We didn't need a whole day for the park. It's a real theme park, not an entertainment park so if you don't have any interest for the historical or samurai theme, it won't be fun for you.
You can bring your own food and there is food here. We didn't try any. You can also wear kimono for the day wich  is nice because the people doing that add to the atmosphere. Even our 3 year old had fun.
A few shows are for free.

李明洋,2019-08-06 06:45:28,5,0,"Toei Kyoto Studio Park is a great place to visit for the whole family. The park covers a wide area, with indoor facilities and outdoor games. The indoor part is mainly composed of cartoon anime, Sailor Moon, Ultraman Series, and the most popular TV drama related dolls  for visitors to take pictures. In the outdoor area, there is a place with a ninja-themed design, including a variety of rides, including a ninja show, a maze, a ninja house with many tricks, and there was a staff dressed as a ninja, sprinkling water to the visitors to reduce the heat and bring happiness to everyone. In addition, the shooting scenes are also preserved here. Many Japanese costume dramas are still being filmed here. Visitors can enter and visit every antique house. Fortunately, they will also see the filming process. So, if you visit Kyoto, don't miss this place on your list.

東映太秦映畫村是個適合全家大小造訪的好地方。園區佔地很廣，有室內設施，也有室外遊戲。室內以卡通動漫為主，有美少女戰士，鹹蛋超人，也有當今最熱門的電視劇相關人偶造型，供遊客拍照。在室外，有一個區域以忍者為主題，設計了許多相關遊樂設施，包括忍者秀、迷宮、忍者機關屋，還有一名工作人員打扮成忍者，在樂園裡向遊客灑水，一邊降低熱氣，一邊帶給每個人歡樂。此外，這裡也保留拍攝場景，至今許多日本古裝劇仍在這裡拍攝，遊客可以造訪每一間古色古香的房屋，幸運的話，還會看到拍片過程。所以，如果您去京都玩，千萬別漏了這個景點。

I recently visited with family and was impressed with the way staff treated children. A grandson got to spend some time playing ninja and was thrilled with the education he received. He was climbing and doing stunts only seen on TV and, was safely harnessed to prevent any injury. A middle aged woman in our group even joined-in on the ninja training. A great place to take a family with active children!

Joe Cochran,2019-11-18 08:44:01,5,5,"I've spent a lot of time in Japan and this is by far one of the most fun places I've been to here. If you have any level of interest in medieval Japan you'll enjoy walking through this well-done mockup village and taking photos with the dressed-up staff. The scheduled events are a lot of fun too. If you go on a weekday it's not so crowded so you'll be able to participate in pretty much all the swordplay events, which are especially fun because the staff actors really get into it.
The signage usually includes English translations and they've also got a capable interpreter on staff who will join you for the tours/participatory events and translate live.
If you've had your fill of shrines and temples, this is a great way to round out your Kyoto experience.

In addition to the galleries of heroes (sentai\power rangers and Kamen Rider), which is cool enough, the rest of this place is a huge recreation of a Japanese Samurai village. Complete with wandering samurai, a monster that creeps out of the water every few minutes, and ninjas everywhere.

There are tons of food options, they're all pretty solid with some unique street food options. The must do thing here is the Ninja Show. It is incredible how much effort they put into this show. Plus, it's really fun and funny, and honestly exciting, even if you dont know any Japanese at all (I don't).

But I can't lie that I'm disappointed with this place. All of the old buildings are pretty and they take me back to the old Japan era. Unfortunately there are some points that I noticed. First, the buildings are dirty and dusty except for some that are frequently visited, e.g. the theatre and the Oiran's house. Second, this place isn't as big as expected and the number of the old buildings aren't that many. Third, most of the buildings are used for paid attractions, e.g. haunted house, maze, trick art etc. Fourth, there isn't any staff wearing costumes like ninja/samurai. Overall, I feel that visiting this place once is more than enough and I don't really want to revisit again. The most attractive one is the ninja show.

It feels like those attractions were made for children mostly (ninja training dojo definitely is for young children).

The cursed doll was awesome, scary and very well done. Not recommended for young or sensitive persons.

Ninja mystery house has great ideas, but way too short and once the explanations are done it's mostly a straight line with not much mystery. It's probably also made with children in mind, but I believe there was great potential here.

Laser mission was a bit fun (we were again definitely not the intended target there), but the laser part was limited to 30s which is way to short. Also I'm not sure with my size it was going to work... a good idea though.

The filming set area was fun, probably even more so if you watched movies before using those locations. There's something in the ""lake"" / water if you go, you just need to wait a bit... it's good fun overall and interesting but mostly empty: lots of houses and places but nothing much in there. It probably makes sense but even though the place is big we didn't feel there was much to see after doing one or two streets.
Maybe consider having photos from movies or informations there ? Treasure hunt or any interaction that would make it a bit more alive.

The trick art museum was super fun, great ideas and you shouldn't miss it! A bit repetitive but great and felt really special.

The anime galery was cool, a few things to see but mostly like a museum and not much information. Some videos but a bit limited (some more information, making of or anything only Toei could do would make it a bit more special).
Also and to add on that, the shops felt a bit uninteresting. Considering all figures and toys in the galery, I was expecting them to try to sell some of them, but the shops only had cheap stuff. Like, not so much ""geek"" stuff, which is a bit suprising considering the people potentially interested in the galery in the first place...

Another weird thing in my opinion is that the theme was Evangelion in the first part of the park. It's really cool with a big Eva torso and head. Not as awesome as the real size Gundam to see, but still a very nice one.
I was a bit puzzled because Evangelion is by no mean a kid's show, but the park was clearly intended a lot for young children.

Last but not least, costumes, make up and wigs from edo period. We did it, I took kimono + wig and my girlfriend took the kimono only. It was fun, they were very professional and we could walk around in the film set and take a bunch of great photos.
On the con side: this is VERY expensive, about 7000 without make up, about 11000 with it, 4500 just a kimono, all that for 1 hour rental (which is plenty since there's not much to do). After that they will take photos of you, and they are really nice, but... 4000 (""small"" photo) to 4500 (bigger size) yens for one photo?? After paying 12000 yens for the rental, it felt really excessive. This is way too much... don't get me wrong, that's a great occasion and place to do that, but it's too much and adds up a lot with the rest of park expenses.
Basically it costs us more than universal studio japan for one day, but with way less value. No regrets, but please Toei reevaluate your prices...

Overall great ideas, worth it, but weird things from organisers, I hope they have more people because it was very quiet, which could be explained with the way it's a bit all over the place and not very though of, organisation wise. Maybe separate children and adult stuff?

Kokisan,2023-04-07 11:20:45,5,1,"The Evangelion Kyoto Base is part of Toei Kyoto Studio Park. If you want to get into it you will need a regular ticket for for the Toei Studio Park (you can purchase it at the counter in person, no need to book in online in advance as Toei Park is a much quieter park, therefore it doesn’t book out) however, I do recommend getting the attraction pass tickets to experience the other attractions in the park (haunted house, ninja maze, etc.) and it’s for unlimited usage of that day. *Some attractions do cost additional, you can choose to pay for them once you find them in the park, we however just decided to do what the pass allowed us to do.

The Toei website was confusing in terms of tickets. We weren’t sure if we were getting into the Evangelion part or not since they seem to seperate the tickets on the website. Just ignore the websites ticketing stuff, as it turns out you don’t even need an extra ticket to go to the Evangelion part of the park. It’s actually included in the regular tickets for Toei Animation Park. It’s free entry with the regular tickets to the park.

Before entry of the Unit 01 attraction, they will ask if you want a free photo taken of you in front of the attraction, photos will be taken once they give and scan your ID QR card for the attraction (ID card is for photo collection at the nearby booth, the personality quiz and sync results of the attraction) you can choose to opt out for the free photo they ask at the start, but you will still keep the QR ID card they gave you as it is needed for the attraction.

(If you choose to take the free photo at the start, after the attraction, bring the ID QR code card to the nearby Photo Booth and only ask for the free photo, they will scan your QR code and the photos will appear on screen. *Photos will be taken automatically if you choose to test your synchronisation rate. If you wish to have those photos printed, they will not be free)

Near the Unit 01 attraction there is an Evangelion Cafe. You can purchase food from the regular Ninja menu and/or the collaboration menu. Each item from the collaboration menu gives you an Evangelion coaster (distributed at random, not dependant on corresponding character food/drink) inside the cafe there is a merch shop currently selling Evangelion goods.
Outside the cafe there are Evangelion standees, great photo opportunities there.

There is a huge piece of art of Evangelion Lunar New Year outside near the cafe, check that out too, it is currently the year of the Rabbit!

I really enjoyed the Toei Animation Park, the theming around Edo era Japan was awesome. We experienced all of the other attractions as well that were included with the tickets. Staff were very friendly and excited, the food was great! I especially enjoyed the Hawaiian Blue shaved ice they served at a few places. Make sure to catch the shows on schedule! The ninja one was really entertaining.",no,,view review

Omri Gilhar,2023-04-25 11:33:39,3,0,"I stumbled upon this place when exploring Kyoto, I’m not a huge fan of Toei related anime/shows, so my review is for people that are same as I.
You need to pay for the entry but if you don’t pay the expensive ticket you will be charge for everything inside. It’s a bit confusing at first but after I wondered the park we understood that every attraction inside the park costs extra…
Still the vibe was good and the staff was very nice and welcoming.

Only school age kids were at the park when I was there, so I didn’t have to wait at all. The big Eva makes the price of the ticket to be worth it.
