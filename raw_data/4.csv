It's not as famous as other temples close by, but it has a lot of historical value, if history is of interest in your exploration of Kyoto. A lot of these stacked stones actually are ancient burial stones. In ancient times people who had no families or money, the temple grounds would be used to leave dead family and people in the forest to become one with nature.  As Japan became more organized the shogun's basically asked the temples to not just leave people laying around decintagrating and to do something with the bodies. Not knowing who many were. Symbolic stones to honour the dead were made, which is what all these stacked stones symbolize. There is more to it then that, I recommend finding a guide and exploring this small temple with a large history. When I was there....there was only one other person walking around, and some monks.

The houses around Adashino are a calm townscape where you can feel the atmosphere of Kyoto. If you walk from Hankyu Arashiyama/Randen Arashiyama Station and take a leisurely walk to Adashino Nenbutsu-ji Temple while feeling the cityscape with your five senses, you will be invited to a healing space with the scenery of the four seasons.

Adashino's ""Adashi"" means ""ephemeral"" and ""empty"" in Buddhist language, and in turn, it means a wish to be reborn in this world or to be reborn in the Pure Land.

I had hoped to visit someday, but the stone Buddhas in the precincts here were the graves of people who were buried in style in the area of ​​Adashi. People and ancestors who were scattered and buried in the mountains and fields of Dashino are resting here.
