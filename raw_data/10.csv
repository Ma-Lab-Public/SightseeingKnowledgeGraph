Victor San Gil,2018-12-29 10:11:32,5,1,"Tenryuji temple was beautiful. There's a fee to visit the grounds at 500yen for the garden and 300yen for the temple. We opted to go through both and we were not disappointed. Before reviewing further, I would recommend that the place be visited during the fall when all the trees still have their autumn color leaves. We visited in late December and while the place was still beautiful, all the trees looked dead. The temple requires you to remove your shoes and had I known that before buying my temple ticket I would not have proceeded. The ground was very cold, but they do make an effort to warm it up a bit by placing mats everywhere. I highly recommend this temple and would definitely go again during autumn.

S. McMahon,2019-05-28 21:26:42,5,0,"Absolutely peace, you can find your zen here if people can act quietly whilst walking around. The weekend attracts a higher foot traffic and so you should visit early in the week to truely understand why the design of this location will relax you. The detail of the gardens is exquisite along with the open temple rooms and so you respect all of it. This garden does lead you onto the infamous Bamboo forest, recommend you visit the forest first and early in the morning whilst there is no one there and then visit the temple when it opens.

One need to pay to go inside the temple. Just a small temple and walk shoeles on the wooden floors. Therein, were the many ornaments and relics.
Generally, a nice place to visit.

Jet Sng,2019-08-31 09:31:41,5,0,"If you want a nice hall with tatami mats to relax in while looking at the beautifuk garden, do enter the temple and just chill for awhile, enjoying the beautiful sights and sounds. For both garden & temple, it's 800 yen.

However, just the garden is good too, costing just 500 yen. It's not in season currently in End of August, so it's mostly green. However, the gardens do lead towards the famous bamboo groves of Kyoto, so you can enjoy the walk through the garden from the main entrance right beside the Randen-Arashimaya Station, directly to the bamboo groves, and the opposite works too, in case you reach earlier.

I think this might just be THE most beautiful garden I've ever walked in. Got there just after opening having been to the Bamboo forest for dawn.
It was Amazing. So beautiful. Made even more special as the autumn leaves were singing.
Lifted the soul and made us even feel like kids looking at the moss covered path. If Pixies Fairy's and Unicorns exist. This is where they live.
What a delight it was.

Spent about a minute there to se everything. Perhaps the price could be lowered to around 1-200 yen to make it worthwhile. 3 stars.

As for the gardens, that was another 500 yen but it was totally worth every penny. Plus one Star.

N Brandon,2023-04-21 11:14:09,4,1,"Genuinely extraordinary place. The temple & garden ticket for ¬•800 is a bit steep, given that you're in most of the same areas: however, the temple ticket enables you to see in close at three pieces of wonderful painted art (an incredible dragon, and two delightfully expressive daruma - I won't spoil them with photos here, its worth being surprised!) and sit on the walkway and enjoy a slightly elevated view of the pond and garden. The garden ticket lets you get in close to the plantlife, and the lovely trilingual botanical signs on the beautiful plants are a lot of fun to read. There is a separate ticket to enter a third area to see what must be an extraordinary painted ceiling of a dragon emerging from clouds, but at another ¬•500 I had to draw the line. Hopefully, next time.

All in all, it is truly beautiful, if crowded and a lil bit over-busy with tourgroups and guides chatting to their people. Just be keyed up for that vibe, and enjoy. Take your time. There are bathroom facilities in reach of ticket holders for either place.

If you are looking to obtain a goshuin after paying your respects, be advised that at the moment the temple does the whole thing as a stamp! Both the red seals... and the black 'calligraphy'!

Max Pietsch (Max),2023-05-14 13:02:27,4,0,"Beautiful gardens here. An interesting example of how rocks, trees, a body of water, and various types of plants can be used to make something beautiful, and how that can be a spiritual practice.

Crowded when we arrived, which kind of soured the experience for us, my girlfriend especially. Get here when they first open if you want a peaceful experience.",no,,view review

Entry fee was only 500 yen for the adult.

Give it a try if you are in the area",no,,view review

K Yeo,2023-05-20 15:27:40,5,0,"Beautiful temple that had royal connections. A princess served as the priestess of the temple. Well-maintained Zen garden with cherry blossoms, well-pruned trees, colourful foliage, clean lines drawn on white sand, flowing streams and calm waters. We made this out last stop in Arashiyama after the bamboo forest and Kameyama Park. There were a lot of people here in the afternoon. We only went into the garden area and did not pay extra to enter the buildings. Many people could sit on the balconies of the main building to enjoy the slightly elevated view. This is a must-visit place when you come to Arashiyama.

Kelly K,2023-05-25 11:40:49,3,0,"This was one of my top desired places to visit but was a bit disappointed when we visited. You should get the ticket and then proceed through the grounds (no shoes). You have a few pretty picture areas and a place to sit in the hot day but overall I was expecting more. It‚Äôs pretty and the bathrooms are nice but it‚Äôs quite small. **You can enter from the bamboo road which is not mentioned on google maps!

Sharad Kambale,2023-05-26 08:54:24,4,0,"Saw this temple from outside as the multiple attractions in the same location - temple, garden, dharma hall were all priced and packaged differently and if one has to see all three it's quite on the expensive side, relative to all other free or less expensive attractions in Japan. We ended up doing only the dharma hall to view the cloud dragon mural which was worth it.

You could honestly spend hours walking around these gardens. They are so full and vibrant, and the view from the top is incredible. The temple itself is gorgeous and sits beside a beautiful pond.
Would 10/10 recommend visiting when in Japan.

Kyle McKay,2023-05-31 07:58:57,5,0,"Site of heritage significance, as a tourist you can enter both the temple (no shoes) and the garden. The temple allows you to walk inside a few select rooms, sit on tatami mats (great on a hot day), and get a closer look of the inside of the site you also have open visibility to the surrounding garden. The garden surrounds the temple with a wonderful pond and and access to/from bamboo road.

We enjoyed garden and temple, but if you want to save money you can do only the garden.

Sander van Vliet,2023-06-03 14:05:36,4,1,"Fine temple to visit but not the highlight of Kyoto. With a wooden boardwalk (in other words, you need to take your shoes off) it's nice to stroll around the temple. There are some nice rooms with decorated walls made from old paintings. I see many pictures of the garden coming by as well, but that's actually separated from each other. Garden only is ¬•500 and with temple entrance fee you pay ¬•800 in total. I advise you to purchase both. Also with the full ticket you have a multi access entrance, so you can use the garden as a walking route between the river side and the Bamboo forest, cause there is an entrance on the north side of the garden as well.
