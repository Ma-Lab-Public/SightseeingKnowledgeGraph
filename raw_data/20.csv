È≠îÊ≥ïÂ∞ëÂ•≥„Åï„Åè„Çâ,2021-10-24 00:10:38,5,4," It is the terminal station of Randen Arashiyama Main Line.
Arashiyama's sightseeing spots spread around the station. It is the main station for sightseeing in Arashiyama, and when it is simply called ""Arashiyama"", it often refers to the area around this station.

There are other train stations that call themselves Arashiyama, but Hankyu Arashiyama Station is about a 10-minute walk across the famous Togetsukyo Bridge, and Saga-Arashiyama Station on the JR Sanin Main Line is not impossible to walk from, but next to it. It is closer from Randen Saga Station.

There are shops selling souvenirs and sweets not only in the surrounding area but also in the station itself, and you can feel the atmosphere of a tourist destination.

On the other hand, the station itself is a manned station, but it is unmanned early in the morning and at night when it is not suitable for sightseeing. The fare is flat and you pay on the train, so there is no problem if you just want to get on the bus, but if you want to purchase a free ticket, be careful.
