AV,2017-12-30 14:47:08,4,3,"Walking down the street is a nice way to understand what old Kyoto looked like, the path is filled with old buildings and shops. Many of the shops are just for tourists, with little authentic old style shops, but the walk up the path allows to reach a beautiful temple and shrine. It gets less crowded after 5pm, while before it is full of people walking up and down.
Reccomended to have a look at the buildings and do some shopping while in Kyoto. You can walk the entire path in 20 minutes and then visit the temples. Take the time to look over Kyoto once you reach the top of the hill for a great view of the city which is hard to get anywhere else.

Some items can be overpriced due to it being a tourist spot, so be aware of prices for different items you may be interested in. Can get very crowded during peak season, as evidenced by my photo.

You can also take some rest in the different restaurant around the street.
If you walk a little bit you can see a ghibli shop which is a way back to childhood if you're a fan of japanimation/ghibli/miyazaki.

Arnold Arkar Moore,2019-02-18 04:26:28,5,4,"This place is beautiful and great for photos, please be mindful as some shops and streets prohibit photography. Best to come here at around 1600, as most of the stores will still be open. I read on a guide that it's best to come at night but I was sorely disappointed as most of the shops were closed. Coming at 1600 and taking a stroll around until its evening would be better as you can shop and take photos. This place looks lovely at night but be careful and watch your step. The kimono rental here is pretty reasonably priced at around 3000 yen, if you're interested. If you happened to come here late, and there's no restaurants open, I suggest walking down to Pontocho, and having a meal there as it is open till late. Be prepared for a lot of walking however as this area is huge!

Sherry Phong,2023-05-08 00:19:40,5,0,"Ninenzaka is a historic district in Kyoto, Japan, known for its traditional buildings, narrow streets, and stone pavement. Based on its reputation and popularity, here is my review:

Five stars out of five for Nineizaka! This beautiful district is a must-visit for anyone traveling to Kyoto, especially for those interested in traditional Japanese culture and architecture. The area is filled with shops, cafes, and temples, and it's a great place to wander around and soak in the atmosphere.

The streets are lined with old buildings, many of which have been converted into shops selling traditional Japanese goods such as pottery, clothing, and sweets. The stone pavement and narrow streets add to the historic charm of the area.

One of the most famous attractions in Ninenzaka is Kiyomizu-dera Temple, which offers stunning views of the city from its hilltop location. Visitors can also enjoy tea ceremonies, try on traditional Japanese clothing, and explore the various temples and shrines in the area.

Overall, Nineizaka (Ninenzaka) is a fantastic destination for those looking to experience traditional Japanese culture and architecture. Its rich history, picturesque streets, and vibrant atmosphere make it a five-star destination in my book
