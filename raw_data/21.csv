ÂíåÊ≠åÂ±±ÂúíÈÉ®,2016-11-06 08:54:40,4,4," I think it's no exaggeration to say that just looking at the long approach leading to the precincts and walking is worth it just for that alone. Just by seeing the well-maintained garden and the Hojo that spreads out when you pass through the long approach, your heart will be cleansed. Surrender yourself to the silence for a moment if you find yourself enveloped in silence that makes it hard to believe that the temple is surrounded by houses.

After its foundation, it was devastated by the Onin War, and only this pagoda remains. In the reliquary hall in the precincts, the relics of the Buddha that Minamoto no Sanetomo received from the Sung dynasty are enshrined. Since October 15th was the date when the Buddhist tusk reliquary arrived in Japan, every year that day is designated as Shari-e, and it is open to the public along with other cultural assets. The photo shows the temple gate with a long and narrow plaque of ``Kakuoyama'' written by Yoshimitsu Ashikaga. From this temple gate to the middle gate and the main hall, there is a stone-paved walkway surrounded by bamboo groves and covered with green moss, leading to a dry landscape garden with Arashiyama as a backdrop. For transportation, get off at ""Rokuoin"" on the Keifuku train or get off at ""Shimosaga"" on the city bus that runs through Sanjo Street. Although Sanjo-dori has relatively heavy traffic, once you step inside, you will find yourself in a quiet and tasteful space.

In the main hall of the mountain, I was surprised to see a splendid Buddha statue up close, such as the statue of Unkei's Shakyamuni, the statue of Ten Great Disciples, and the statue of Yoshimitsu Ashikaga, the founder (the person who built the temple).

„Çµ„É≥„ÉàËàπÈï∑,2018-06-06 19:55:50,3,1," Rokuo-in Temple was a sub-temple (a temple built to protect the tomb towers of successive chief priests in Zen temples) of Hodo-ji Temple, which was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA. Hodo-ji Temple was abolished during the Onin War, and after that only Rokuo-in Temple, which was the sub-temple of the founder of the temple, remains and inherits the temple register.

According to ""Kanei Sandaiki"", a record of the Muromachi period, and ""Hodo Kaizan Kankaku Fumyo Kokushi Gyogyo Jitsuroku,"" which is a biography of Kaizan, the history of the construction of Hodo-ji Temple is as follows. One night in the first year of Koryaku (1379), Yoshimitsu Ashikaga made a dream declaration, ``You will suffer a serious illness this year, but if you build a temple to enshrine Hozo Bosatsu, your life will be extended.'' received. Therefore, Yoshimitsu decided to build a temple with the Zen monk Haruya Myohan (Fumyo Kokushi) to whom he devoted himself as the founder, and completed it in 1380. It is said that the original name of the temple was Koshoji, but later it was changed to Hodo-ji (the full name is Daifukuda Hodozen-ji). Rokuo-in Temple was built in 1387 as a sub-temple to protect the Kotobuki Pagoda (grave built during his lifetime) of founder Haruya Myohan (Haruya died in the following year, 1388).

The Buddha tooth reliquary here seems to be real. The garden is also bobo (there are some rare plants), but it seems that this is also the Zen spirit of this temple.

12 3,2018-10-26 11:46:27,3,5," Rokuoin is located in the Sagano area of ‚Äã‚ÄãKyoto, about a 15-minute walk from Arashiyama and Togetsukyo Bridge. Many people don't know about its existence because it is located a little far from popular spots such as Tenryu-ji Temple and Sagano Bamboo Grove, so it is a temple that can be visited relatively calmly even during the peak season of autumn leaves.

Because the surrounding area is a residential area, the area around ""Rokuoin"" is not so busy with tourists. The small temple gate that comes into view is the entrance to Rokuo-in. The temple was founded by Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, the temple gate of Rokuo-in Temple, and on the plaque, Yoshimitsu himself wrote ``Kakuoyama''.

An ancient temple gate that has been around for over 600 years. If you can see the straight approach to the shrine from there, you will definitely get excited!

Once you pass through the gate, you will suddenly rush into the highlight. Just seeing the beauty of this approach is worth a visit! Overhead is a tunnel of red autumn leaves, and a straight stone pavement with a moss carpet on the side.

Usually late November is the best time to see the autumn leaves, but the beauty of the peak season is so beautiful that you will be at a loss for words. As mentioned above, there are no sources of noise around Rokuo-in, which is located in a residential area, so you can enjoy a luxurious space thanks to the silence.

There are many tourists who are stranded because of the beauty of the approach! You will return on the same approach on your way back, but you will be looking forward to the view from the other side as well.

Rokuo-in is an independent temple of the Rinzai sect. It was one of the sub-temples of Hoso-ji Temple, which was built by Yoshimitsu Ashikaga, but Hoso-ji Temple was destroyed by fire during the Onin War.

In Kyoto, there are many temples for tourists, which are called visiting temples. As a venerable Zen temple, it continues to protect the place of training to this day. When you visit, don't forget the feeling that you will be disturbed there.

The main garden that can be seen from the reception hall is a garden with Arashiyama as a borrowed landscape, and is considered to be Japan's oldest dry landscape garden. With Arashiyama dyed in brocade in the background, and looking at the autumn leaves in the garden and the impressive reliquary hall, time seems to pass slowly. It is a perfect temple for those who want to spend a quiet time. And when you go home, you may think, ""I don't want to tell people about this place.""

Rokuo-in became a hot topic when it was lit up at night for the first time in the fall of 2016. The gate is limited to 100 people per day, but many tourists flocked to see the mysterious world that is different from the daytime.

It has already been decided that this nighttime viewing will continue in 2018. It used to be limited to 100 people a day, but this year the limit has been expanded to 100 people a day on weekdays and 150 people on weekends and holidays. Please note that this is a pre-registration system from the internet!

It's always nice to be quiet and calm, even though it's a place where you can't miss the name of Lord Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. It seems that Ikkyu also visited frequently.

Yopey,2021-04-13 10:14:26,4,5," Visited on 2021/04. Coco's temple is more suitable for immersing yourself in its tranquility while looking at the garden, rather than visiting to see various cultural properties. The Randen train passes through the north side of the temple, but it doesn't disturb the quietness. Please note that the reliquary hall is currently under construction and cannot be visited. Also, if there is no receptionist, please wait patiently or ring the bell at the entrance.

ÂÆÖË¶ãËÇá,2021-07-17 03:10:10,5,11," The Rinzai sect temple built by Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, the moment you pass through the gate, you will be amazed by the splendid moss garden and green autumn leaves, and the straight stone-paved approach to the temple.
If you ring the bell yourself, the chief priest will come out. Pay the entrance fee of 400 yen and proceed according to the route.
The highlight is the forehead of the reception hall, which is written by Yoshimitsu Ashikaga. It's a pity that the previous reliquary hall is under construction, but you can enjoy the taste of the garden.
Photography is prohibited inside the main hall, but you can see the statues of Shaka Nyorai and the Ten Major Disciples, the statue of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, the founder of the foundation, the statue of Miroku Bodhisattva, and the statue of Kaizan Fumyokushi. I'm pretty sure there is a statue of Yoshimitsu at Tojiin Temple...
Another picture map of the Saga area from the 15th century was on display. Tenryu-ji Temple, Rokuo-in Temple, Daikaku-ji Temple, and Nison-in Temple were unknown at the time (laughs).
No tourists üòä
Like Toji-in, you can sit in front of the reception hall and look at the garden. I was able to relax in just 5 minutes of blank time üòÉ

This is a sub-temple of Hodoji Temple, which was built in 1380 during the Muromachi period by Yoshimitsu Ashikaga, the third shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate. Hodo-ji Temple was destroyed by fire during the Onin War and was abolished, leaving only Rokuo-in Temple. It holds many important cultural properties, and the principal image of Shaka Nyorai and the statues of the ten great disciples are said to have been made by Unkei. It is also the name of the station on the Randen Arashiyama Main Line.

If you look at the garden, you can't see the shariden, which is completely covered during renovation work. I left in 3 minutes because there was nothing to see. Do you charge an admission fee for this? At the very least, at the time of payment, the Reliquary Hall is being renovated, is that okay? I wanted you to ask. I wanted the door of the reception hall to be open for visitors. At least if you can't see the Shariden. I will never go there again.

We visited during the fall foliage season, and the alley that leads from the entrance already creates an atmosphere where you can fully enjoy the autumn season. The colorful autumn leaves of the trees, which are mixed with red, yellow, and green, are truly the world of autumn. I was able to spend a leisurely time in the dry landscape garden, tea room, and other places where time passed slowly. It is a temple that you would like to visit not only in autumn, but also in all four seasons. How about stretching your legs when visiting Tenryu-ji Temple?

It was cold and unbearable. However, the family of the temple was also protected by this temple. The next time you stay at this time of year, I would like to revisit even if I prepare clothes for outdoor activities. The early morning hours in the garden were often a blissful moment of solace in the silence, gazing at the splendid garden while basking in the sunshine. The hearty breakfast was also very good. I also want to go in other seasons, such as fall and winter.

Teddy‚Äôs TED,2022-11-22 02:15:27,4,1," During the autumn foliage season in Kyoto, if you go to a popular tourist area, you will be overwhelmed by the crowds, but this is a hidden foliage spot that stands quietly in the middle of the city. An admission fee is required during the autumn foliage season, but the price is relatively reasonable at 400 yen for adults.
Unfortunately, the reliquary hall is currently under construction and I can't see it, and the sound of the construction echoed in the garden.
I'm sorry that the quietness was supposed to be a selling point, but it was a little unsettling environment.

The yard is not big, but there are not many tourists. The red leaves are not as lively and open as other scenic spots, which is a fly in the ointment.
