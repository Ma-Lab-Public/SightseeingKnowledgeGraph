Christopher Robinson,2016-07-10 15:29:51,5,1,"Saying this house and its gardens are wonderful, is still an understatement. Temple gardens are certainly nice, but this one is so peaceful. Even with many visitors coming to the bamboo forest nearby, few take the opportunity to visit this calm place. It will be all your to admire. Beautiful trees and bushes, the small wooden shrine, all the stone pathways, seas of moss surrounding it all. This is to be enjoyed quietly, and if you felt somewhat stressed when arriving, you will leave appeased.",no,,view review

There were a decent number of people inside the garden (people had to wait for each other to take photos against the more striking features of the garden, for example) but even so, it's designed in such a way that the rest of the world falls away between hedges and it is possible to take a little meditative walk even in the middle of such a touristy area. Very nice to have the hot matcha with a little sweet outside under the red maples and yellow gingko.

There's signs indicating the suggested route through the garden, which takes you to a couple breathtaking views of the mountains.

Of course, our walks were interrupted by photo-ops before the shrine,  inside the tea house and the courtyard dedicated to the owner (a famous period actor),  beside a couple of cultural houses, and in front of a beautiful  middle gate.

What a wonderful walk through trees, shrubs, flowers, past shrines, and up and down gently rolling hills with faraway views. The house itself was not open to visit, but the surrounding grounds are relaxing and rejuvenating.

The matcha tea that's included in the entry price was fine, but the atmosphere in the tea room was a bit depressing compared to others we visited, and the sweet we were given with the tea had expired 5 years ago.

M L,2023-04-08 10:06:08,5,1,Pretty garden and walk. You hear a lot of birds on the trail and it's quieter than the average Kyoto temple garden.,no,,view review
Anna McMullen,2023-04-14 06:05:59,4,0,"It‚Äôs a nice garden with good views. Although there is a high entrance fee, that means less people go there so it‚Äôs less crowded. The best season to go is fall!",no,,view review
Chris P,2023-04-24 03:17:40,5,0,Beautiful location and amazing views. Totally worth the price of admission to get away from the crowds.,no,,view review
Laura F,2023-04-28 03:08:20,5,2,"I was surprised how quiet it was given how crowded the bamboo forest and surrounding streets were. Beautiful, lush grounds and a really nice teahouse too. I‚Äôd recommend it!

Harriet Fisher,2023-05-07 07:17:42,5,2,"Relatively high ticket price for Japan but absolutely worth it for the stunning gardens and views. Do not miss if visiting Arashiyama. We arrived at about 10am and had the garden to ourselves; it was magical.

Victoria Anne Marilyn,2023-05-09 00:12:10,5,0,"What a beautiful place!!
Amidst the busy bamboo forest lies this beautiful quiet gem.

The garden was massive, and equipped with walking paths that lead to amazing views. A cup of hot green tea and traditional biscuits was the icing on the cake.

It‚Äôs so sad how people skip this garden just cause you have to pay 1000 YEN Entry. But I‚Äôm glad that there wasn‚Äôt many people, because we were isolated amongst ourselves and enjoyed the tranquility away from the business of the bamboo forest 1000% recommend

Anna Bruce,2023-05-14 13:16:56,5,0,"An incredibly beautiful sprawling garden nestled in the bamboo forest. We went in autumn and the colours were astounding. Stayed there for two hours just enjoying the peace and beauty.

Anna F,2023-05-21 07:32:05,5,0,"Absolute paradise comparing to the crowds in Arashiyama bamboo trail. I would recommend everyone to pay a little extra and visit the garden. No surprise it took the owner 30 years to build it, you can notice this in every detail and curve of the tree branch or the stone paving the road.

Max,2023-05-27 13:11:07,5,0,"Beautiful and peaceful place away from the crowd in the bamboo forest. The entrance fee includes a sweet and drink which you can choose to have before or after your walk around the garden.

I‚Äôm sure this place is super popular during the fall for the colours. Will be back!

HANS HSN,2023-05-27 16:43:52,5,1,"Absolutely incredible. Never seen anyone rave about this place at all, costs 1000 yen gets you free drink at their traditional tea house and following the paths around to explore the garden and ending up on top of the hill overlooking some breathtaking views over Kyoto. Absolutely recommended!

Sander van Vliet,2023-06-04 05:49:57,5,0,"Again a very beautiful garden. Also again 5 stars cause the setting of this garden is different from others. There is a designated walking route through the garden which goes uphill. There are green parts, with nice grass landscapes but also parts with gravel and needle trees. A stepping stone path with a forest covered with moss is present as well. The entrance is to be taken from the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove area and goes uphill. In the entrance fee a cup of free matcha tea and a small sweet is included. The signs to the tea house are a bit unclear, but it's located next to the entrance.
