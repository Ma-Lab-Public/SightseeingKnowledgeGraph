This is one of the 3 major temples around this area near the mountainous valley along Kiyotaki River in Takao and the one designated as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site. The establishment of this temple was in Nara period and it was originally a sub-temple of Jingoji temple. It was 1206 in Kamakura Period when Emperor Gotoba bestowed this temple on Saint Myoe and later it was revived as current Kozanji Temple. The temple Is surrounded by beautiful nature and loved by historical figures such as Yasunari Kawabata, Masako Shirasu as it is introduced in their books. As well as being selected out as an old temple it has also gained its fame for the arts of caricature depicting animals in human-like characters called ""Choju-jinbutsu-giga"" ( The illustrated handscrolls of frolicking animals and humans ). They are the origin of current Japanese manga culture. Some of those works are currently preserved in Kyoto National Museum. The temple also holds various type of treasures such as Buddhist paintings, painted scrolls designated as national treasures. There are many goods associated with Saint Myoe. Especially wood sculptures of a small dog suggest a person who was found of dogs. Kosanji Temple is also known as a place where the culture of drinking tea was first introduced in Japan. The origin of tea culture in Japan is believed to be formed when the founder of Rinzai sect of Buddhism Yousai Zenji brought tea from country of Sung ( current China ) and taught this practice to Saint Myoe. Toganoo is a ground where the very first tea plantation in Japan was started. In this temple there is a stone monument of a place where the oldest field of tea plantation was. The tea was believed to contain composition to ward off sleepiness. The priest of the temple later transplanted seedling to Uji and spread out to the rest of the country. Back in that time the tea grown in this ground was the only kind considered to be authentic production and this Kosanji tea was annually served to the Emperor. Saimyoji is the next one located in the south of Kosanji Temple. Jingoji Temple is the one next to Saimyoji in its west. Next to Jingoji is a trail connected to village of Kiyotaki. Please check the direction guide posts on your way.

I had a bad feeling when an elderly brown-haired woman came out, but there were many broken tea whisks in the tea. There were a lot of them in my companion's, so I can only assume that they used a very worn out tea whisk, or that someone who didn't know how to make tea didn't boil it and stirred it with all their might.

When I showed him a piece of tea whisk when I left, the young man apologized with a low head, but no refund was given. I couldn't drink properly, but when I saw the person who let me in without even apologizing and talking in the back, I wondered if it was someone related to the temple.

I would like the people concerned to reflect on the history of Kozanji and correct their attitude. If you can't provide decent tea, I think you shouldn't serve it.

The Choju Giga here is a replica, the original is in the National Museum in Tokyo. The garden can be messy and untidy. It's not worth paying 1300 yen (800 yen + 500 yen) and spending a lot of time and money on transportation to go all the way to the mountains.

miki,2022-10-07 07:09:32,1,42," It's too far from the city center to feel like you're in a famous temple in Kyoto. I travel to Kyoto every year, but this was my first visit. I was wondering how to access it. Considering mobility, I took a taxi from Kyoto Station. In the off-season it takes less than 30 minutes. About 5000 yen for 3 people. On the way back, a taxi came if I called at the municipal parking lot.

Climb the back approach to the temple from the municipal parking lot. An entrance fee of 500 yen is charged here only during this season. It seems that the municipal parking lot will also be charged during the autumn leaves season. An additional 800 yen is required to enter Sekisui-in. I received a goshuin at the entrance of Sekisuiin, but since there was no one to write it, it was 300 yen just to write it down. Later I noticed that the paper was not white but cream colored.

Sekisui-in is the biggest attraction, but it's so small. It doesn't take more than 30 minutes to sit down and take a leisurely look at the garden. There was almost no guide inside, and if I had been careless, I would have overlooked even Choju Jinbutsu Giga. Most of the numerous national treasures and important cultural properties cannot be seen here, even their reproductions.

Even if it is a reproduction of Choju Jinbutsu Giga, only the famous first volume is the actual size, and that is not the whole, but only a part. As for the remaining volumes, I was stunned to see that only a portion of the three reduced-size volumes were displayed as a bonus. Shouldn't we display the full-size replica of Choju-jinbutsu-giga, which is the biggest selling volume, not just a part of it, but the whole thing? The biggest sale is this treatment, and there is a caricature of birds and beasts, like a heron.

And I don't know at all where photography is OK and where it is NG. All Zenzai Doji were taking pictures. Looking at it, it seemed that most of the things in Sekisuiin, including the puppy statues and the caricatures of animals and animals, were allowed to be photographed.

I accidentally came here with casual socks and the soles of my feet were very cold and I was in trouble. Also, there were many stink bugs in the sun on the porch, so I was careful not to step on them. If you don't want to see autumn leaves, I think it's definitely better to visit during the fresh green season.

Although it is a temple of the Shingon sect, the impression received is that of a Zen temple. I wanted to go to Jingo-ji Temple, but I gave up after consulting with my physical strength. There were no people walking on the national highway leading to Jingo-ji Temple. It's a dangerous road with a lot of traffic and no sidewalks or guardrails.

Kyoto and Kaohsiung seem to be struggling with regional development. I felt that it was a temple that did not make the most of its many precious cultural assets.

In addition to the entrance fee of 500 yen in autumn, it costs an additional 800 yen to enter Sekisui-in. If you go by car, the municipal parking lot across the street (1040 yen) is convenient.

If you go around Saimyoji and Jingoji, I think you can park in the Kaohsiung Kanko Hotel parking lot (1000 yen). However, in November only, on Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays, you cannot enter and exit by car from 11:00 to 16:00. Also, since the approach road is narrow, it is easier to park in the municipal parking lot.

Both Kondo and Kaizando are small buildings that cannot be entered. Stumps were conspicuous in the precincts, and it looked quite rough (due to a typhoon?), and the atmosphere was not good.

After all, there is only Sekisuiin as the main character. It is different if you are looking for a picture scroll of birds and beasts (reproduction), but it was not as much as I expected as a world heritage site. I wonder if 1300 yen is expensive with this...
