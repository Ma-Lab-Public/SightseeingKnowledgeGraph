Magnus Jørgensen,2018-05-17 14:10:43,4,1,"Price: 500yen
The temple has a resonably sized cemetary which to us was a bit underwhelming as we visited Okunoin Cemetary a few days earlier. There are many better cemetaries spread out in Japan than this one. Definately recommend The Okunoin one.
The temple however was situated in a very idyllic setting and there were very few other tourist around when we visited. It was very quiet and peaceful. The temples Goshuin is also very beautiful, definately worthy of any Goshuin book.

Overall I would say that the 500 yen entry price is a bit high for what you get, 300 would fit better. If you would like to see a beautiful cemetary and a peaceful temple then it's worth the price, but if you only want to see one of the two then there are other better options.

Unfortunately, it was about a month early for autumn leaves, but they started to color for a minute.
After walking along the quiet autumnal approach to the temple, we headed to the main hall, which enshrined two Buddha statues, Shaka Nyorai and Amida Nyorai, which were created by Kasuga Buddhist sculptor in the mid-Kamakura period.
Nison-in, which stands at the eastern foot of Mt. Ogura, was written in the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu, and I was able to spend a quiet time.

みねやん,2023-01-12 21:37:50,4,0," The temple enshrines two deities, Shaka Nyorai and Amida Nyorai, and is officially called 'Ogurayama Nisonkyoin Kedai-ji', and was built by Emperor Saga's imperial request.
The long and wide approach to Mt. Ogura, which passes through the main gate, visually expands and gives you a sense of calmness. I think that the refreshing feeling of the fresh green season, the strength of the summer, and the glamorous colors of the mountains and autumn foliage in the fall.
The main hall is also really comfortable, and I think it is a luxurious space to sit in the corridor of the Indian summer, quietly contemplate, and feel the periodic sound of Shishiodoshi.
The precincts are wide and you can climb the stone steps further and enjoy the view of Kyoto city from the Arashiyama area.

樽谷英樹,2023-02-04 05:49:51,4,0," I walked about 5 minutes from Jojakko-ji Temple.

The origin of the name of [Nison-in] is that two bodies, [Shaka Nyorai] and [Amida Nyorai] are enshrined.

Together with Tathagata who will guide us from now on
The other one is the Tathagata who will guide us after we die😌

I personally liked the autumn leaves 🍁 at [Jojakkoji] better 😌

伊勢守,2023-03-06 01:11:24,5,0," Nison-in is a temple of the Tendai sect of Buddhism and has the same mountain name as Jojakko-ji Temple, which is located to the south. It is also one of the traditional places of ""Shiguretei"" which is Ogura Sanso of Teika Fujiwara. At the boundary between Nison-in Temple and Jojakko-ji Temple, there is a stone monument that says 'the place where Ogura Hyakunin Isshu was compiled'. There is also a theory that the mountain villa straddled both temples.
It was founded in the Heian period, but since it was revived by a disciple of Honen in the early Kamakura period, it was strongly influenced by the Jodo sect, but it seems that it officially belonged to the Tendai sect in the Edo period. There are many graves of famous people such as Sanetaka Sanjonishi, Ryoi Kadokura, Jinsai Ito and his son Togai, and Tsumasaburo Bando. The wide stone-stepped slopes are often used as filming locations for period dramas, and have been seen many times in movies and TV dramas.
The third image is the tomb of the Sanjonishi family, a court noble who produced many poets and scholars. The tombs of Sanetaka, Kojo, and Sanue, who were active from the late Muromachi period to the Azuchi-Momoyama period, are lined up.

I H,2023-03-08 09:16:19,5,0," On September 25th, 2020, I walked from Saga-Arashiyama Station on the JR Sagano Line, walked around Sagano, and went to Nison-in.

Nison-in is said to be the birthplace of Ogura Hyakunin Isshu and Ogura bean jam, just as it is called Ogurayama.

It is said that the origin of the name of the temple is that it enshrines Shaka Nyorai and Amida Nyorai as its principal images.

When you pass through the main gate, the approach stretches in a straight line, and the branches of autumn leaves cover the approach from both sides, so I wanted to come during the autumn leaves season🍁

You can ring the bell of the bell tower at Nison-in Temple 😀 It is called the Bell of Happiness

There is the grave of Ryoi Suminokura❗️Also, the view from the site of Fujiwara no Teika's Shigure-tei is the best😊

TORU,2023-03-16 22:00:34,5,0," By the time I got here, the number of tourists in Arashiyama had decreased considerably. Admission fee is 500 yen. Important cultural properties of Shaka Nyorai and Amida Nyorai are enshrined here. Waka poems related to this place are posted here and there, and it is remembered that it became a place for selection of Hyakunin Isshu. It was a well-maintained temple with many attractions.

成澤小百合,2023-03-29 10:57:37,5,0," The principal images of Buddha are Shaka Nyorai, who sends those who aim for paradise from this shore, and Amida Nyorai, who invites them to the other shore (both important cultural properties). At the main hall, you will be greeted by two very similar deities standing side by side. If you put your hands together in front of it, you will feel relieved. In the precincts, there is also the grave of Ryoi Suminokura, who was a wealthy merchant in Kyoto who worked hard on river civil engineering.

たけほがら,2023-05-02 13:53:09,5,0," I came here when the cherry blossoms were in full bloom. The slope leading from the main gate to the black gate and the imperial messenger gate was covered with pale cherry blossoms.

Passing through the imperial gate, there were large cherry trees on the left and right, and the branches seemed to bend with the flowers in full bloom.

This temple was founded by the imperial request of Emperor Saga, and is said to have been named Nison-in because it enshrines two deities, 'Shaka Nyorai' and 'Amida Nyorai'.

This is a place where you can enjoy both the autumn leaves season and the cherry blossom season. You will surely be able to enjoy the wonderful scenery even during the fresh green season. Next comes the season of fresh green.

As the two main deities were holding their hands over me, I felt that they were receiving a great deal of attention.

Ben Hsu,2023-05-17 01:57:51,5,0,"Nisonin [or Nison-in] Temple [the Temple] is located within very short walking distance from Seiryoji Temple of Saga area, Kyoto. It worships Great Buddha, although it also worships other Buddhist deities which have Chinese or Japanese origination inside the Temple courtyard.

The Temple was created in the 9th Century with the blessing of then Emperor Saga, although it was rebuilt around 15th century due to Onin War, because the Temple had close relations with the Imperial Family. From the Meiji era, Nisonin Temple belongs to the Tendai sect of Buddhism.

For many visitors and worshippers, the Temple is famous for its garden beauty- cheery blossom in March to early April, hydrangeas in late Spring and colorful foliage of the Japanese maples in fall, and they are planted along the main road from the main gate to the main worship hall. Another strength or uniqueness of the Temple is its serenity in silence in the garden and courtyard when visitors can also enjoy the beauty of the garden.

Sun Rose,2023-06-02 05:17:54,2,0," I visited in the afternoon of GW.
As I passed through the main gate and walked along the approach to the shrine lined with beautiful fresh green foliage, I began to feel a little uneasy. And the anxiety gradually increased.
The anxiety was that workers were cleaning the garden of the main hall with a machine. The problem is not the sight, but the ""sound"". There is no escape from noise.
The horrifying mechanical noise reverberated throughout the main hall from around the time I passed through the imperial gate.
The pamphlet at the reception said, ""Please listen carefully to the trees and birds chirping in the silence.""
If it weren't for the noise, I think I would have been able to feel a sense of calm and bliss.
It was unfortunate that I could go to this famous temple once in my life.
