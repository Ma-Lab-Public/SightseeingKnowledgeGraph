me windowsi,2022-08-15 05:44:05,2,1," It is a road with two lanes on each side with a lot of traffic and many buses and taxis. It is a road where Hankyu and subway lines pass below. However, there were many cars with bad manners, and there were quite a few illegally parked cars. Besides, there was a lot of traffic, so I think it would be the worst if I drove on the road. .

Shingo Sae-Lim,2021-11-30 12:27:45,3,1,"(Trip was made back then on 30 Nov 2019, 2 years before the Covid-19 Pandemic hit)

Our first stop was Nishikori Market Shopping Street upon reaching Kyoto in the early morning 2 years ago on this very day.

The market caters to both locals and tourists, offering a wide variety of goods for sale, ranging from street food snacks, to merchandise and eateries, as well as fresh seafood and preserved vegetables.

There were so many choices but we decided to only try a few and save room for lunch. The street food snacks ranged from decent to tasty, but nothing was really an attention grabber.

During pre-Covid-19 times, manoeuvring down the street proved to be challenging due to the large crowd of people being crammed into a narrow street.

It’s an interesting place to visit as a first timer but Kyoto has many more interesting attractions and Nishiki lacks the attractiveness to entice us to revisit anytime soon.

Nishiki Market is very clean and the products are neatly arranged. Most of the products sold are locally produced and the market offers very fresh seafood.
