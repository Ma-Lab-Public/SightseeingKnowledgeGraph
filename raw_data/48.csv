Trans-word plus TGM,2018-07-29 12:48:51,5,1,"Sanzen-in Temple is located in a mountainous town of Ohara in the northern part of Sakyo-ku. The temple belongs to Tendai sect of Buddhism established in the late 8th century by saint Saicho. Sain Saicho is most known as a founder of Enryakuji Temple. The main object of worship is Yakushi Nyorai statue. The origin of the temple can trace its roots to Enyubo on Mt. Hiei which is located in the south-west of Ohara during the period of Sain Saicho. It was later relocated to Ohara in 1871. This is why the temple has another name of remains of a gate to the late Sanzen-in Temple. Out of those three major Monzeki ( remains of a gate ) Temples of Tendai sect, Sanzen-in has the oldest one. There is a famous Amida Sanson Statues ( three bodies of Amida Nyorai statues ) placed in its main hall right in the center of a garden covered in deep green moss. In its precincts there are two streams running. One is called Ryosen and another one is called Ritsusen. Those names can be reffered to the rhythm of a Buddhist sutra.

The temple is built in an extensive area at the foot of a mountain and its surrounding area has many other Buddhist temples connected with a narrow paths. You could spend half a day just strolling around this area full of attractions. Along the way to the temple is a path filled with many souvenir shops. You might notice some shops selling Shibazuke ( pickled egg plants seasoned with Shiso leaves ). Shiso leaves are the local special product in Ohara. Sanzen-in is mostly visited among tourists wishing to see autumn leaves in November, but you should not miss the seasonal beauty of its Hydrangeas bloom in June. The temple is never crowded except for the autmn season. You can fully enjoy the tranquility of its atmosphere. We highly recommend that when you come to Ohara, spend the whole day exploring around the town.

Rani S Ekawati,2019-12-06 15:47:14,5,0,"You won't regret visit Sanzen-in in autumn. It is the most beautiful of all temples I visited in Kyoto. From Kyoto take bus number 17 to Ohara (remind you that there is city bus also number 17 that will take you to the last bus stop near Nanzen-ji, so don't mix them up). From Ohara bus stop you just have to follow people. Most of them will go to Sanzen-in anyway. The bus ride to Ohara was amazing with beautiful scenery along the way. The 700 yen of entrance fee will be worth it, you literally be able to enter all buildings, including treasure hall) and garden. This place is massive. I spent like 2 hours in this place to cover all the area. Be ready for dreamy scenery all over the place in autumn. It may take around 1 hr from Tokyo station, but go here anyway.  You won't regret it. Make sure to walk on all the narrow path here, especially near the bridge.

This is the most serene temple. You can walk through the corridors and enjoy the gardens either from inside the temple or the terrace. Some people spend some time just to sit and enjoy the serenity.

Sure the bus ride (Ohara #17 bus) took 40mins and there's an additional 10-minutes hike needed. But when you're inside it will all pay off.

One of Kyoto go-to list, just take the Bus number 17 bound to Ohara, and ride it till the last station (Ohara). From there you just need to walk another 12 minutes. The scenery of the surrounding area is worth to see, really captivating and relaxing!

If you bought the one day pass, you must pay additional fare before you get off, so please be prepared.

That said, many temples do offer a wonderful calming experience, especially in the rain and even without the leaves. This temple felt a little overhyped and did not really do it for me. Aspects of it were beautiful, and the landscaped garden area was huge, but it was a bear to get to and I didn't like having to figure out which of the parking lots wasn't a ripoff.
