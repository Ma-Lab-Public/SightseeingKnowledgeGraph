there are a couple of nice temples and from the top if you feel adventurous you can hike up a hill through a forest and get a very view of Kyoto. You can also hike along the river at bottom, which is very nice. Definitely easy to spend half day in here.

Nicolette,2019-08-19 10:29:58,5,1,"As beautiful as the pictures!! We woke up really early and arrived around 6:30am on a Monday morning via the JR train to Saga Arashiyama station. It’s about a 10 minute walk to the bamboo forest. There were very few people when we arrived. The bamboo forest area is smaller than I expected, but stunning. After you walk through the bamboo area, there are other short trails you can take to get an amazing view of the river and surrounding mountains (turn left at the end of the bamboo path, then walk up the hill to your right). You can also walk along the river on the other side, across the bridge. There are lots of bathrooms. I wore Chaco sandals and was comfortable walking around. We spent about two hours slowly meandering around the area and then went on the Hozugawa River boat ride (which I would highly recommend!!). When we were done with the boat ride around 11:30, Arashiyama was packed.",no,,view review
Brandy Nobles,2019-08-21 14:30:43,5,0,"We spent the whole day in Arashiyama visiting the monkey park and taking a tour boat up the Oi River.

By the time we made it to Kameyama, it was getting dark and the bamboo forest was eerie and enchanting. I understand now why there are legends about things living in the forests in Japan.

Coming from the Arashiyama Monkey Park side, walking through the grove leads to the JR Station, which was convenient for the end of the day. We were able to walk through the grove and then catch a train back to Kyoto on the other side.

If you're in the area, I highly recommend visiting Kameyama Park. The photos I took really don't do it justice.
