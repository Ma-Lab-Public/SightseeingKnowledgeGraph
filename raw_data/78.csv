The 5-tier wooden pagoda is stunning framed by the Sakura in spring and probably also in fall foliage. There are some Buddha statues for viewing in both the main and lecture hall but photography is not permitted inside. The temple is within walking distance from Kyoto station.

Jedi Master,2019-04-29 01:03:40,5,0,"Of all places to visit in Kyoto this is a must no doubt. The place is enormous so allow time to visit. There are two options to buy a ticket..one for the outside main buildings and another for some inside temples and special exhibits if there is any.
If you go early is best as it will be crowded with tour buses and school groups. We like quiet so we went early.
In some areas pictures are not allowed because of a new directive trying to control the use of pictures in order to give the proper respect to all objects..even if tempted please don‚Äôt ! It just make us tourists look like savages which we are not.

Google said it was 500 yen entry for one person, but that's the price of a child. The price of an adult is 1000 yen. I thought it was a little expensive, but that thought quickly vanished when I stepped foot inside and saw all the maple trees illuminated. Even though it's the end of the autumn leaf season, there's still plenty of hardy trees that are showing off their full colours. The pagoda was also exceptionally gorgeous, and it was only exemplified by it being lit up at night. It's also huge! There's also 2 buildings where you can see very large Buddhist statues. You get a sense of awe while viewing them. I would definitely recommend going to the illumination if you're there around the time it's happening. P.S.

The temple itself is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is rich with history and culture. It was amazing to see the intricate details of the architecture and the attention to detail that went into the design. Additionally, there were several exhibitions showcasing the history of the temple and its significance in Japanese culture.

The atmosphere at To-ji Kyoto was peaceful and serene, despite the large crowds of people visiting. It was a perfect place to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city and take in the beauty of the temple.

Overall, I highly recommend a visit to To-ji Kyoto, especially at night when the illuminations make the temple even more magical. It's a great way to learn about the history and culture of Japan while taking in the breathtaking sights.

You will need to entry fees. When you get inside the Kondo (main hall) you can see gigantic and magnificent Buddha. (Make sure not to miss it) and the pagoda is magnificent too.

As we wanted to explore Kyoto city, we walked from the Kyoto station which took like 15 mins.

Sneha Kumar,2023-05-06 11:15:33,5,1,"UNESCO World Heritage site. Must visit in Kyoto. Two Buddhist temples and huge pagoda surrounded by amazing garden and lake. Statues of God are huge and mesmerizing environment. You will feel calm immediately entering the premises. I visited here on special visiting hours of evening. It's amazing experience to visit shrine in dark.

There are several Buddha and Buddhism-related statues that are said to be over a thousand years old, a breathtaking sight.

Alexis Godeke,2023-05-20 08:29:24,4,1,"The temples and shrines here were beautiful! There was an admission fee of 800ÂÜÜ to see them, and there was not much to see, so it felt a little over priced. The crowd was not too bad early afternoon on a Saturday, but we may have been lucky.

Nicola,2023-05-27 00:53:42,5,1,"The Golden hall (the main one) and lecture hall are massive buildings with many great Buddha wooden statues.
Those statues are very impressive in size and details. Make sure to grab the brief guide at the entrance cause there are not many informative panels written in English.
The pagoda, all wood made and original from '600 is quite impressive. You can only walk around it, there's no entrance of such.

It costs 500¬• for the pagoda and the halls, 800¬• with the admissions to the housing complex (same area).
