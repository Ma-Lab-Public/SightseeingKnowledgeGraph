It is very quiet, not as many tourists, slightly creepy, and very serene. You can spend so much time looking at each statue and getting lost in your thoughts.

Viet Dinh,2017-07-12 12:10:01,5,4,"Otagi Nenbutsu-ji lived up to its name as the temple with hundreds stone heads. You can find a lots of stone figures over here. It's better to go here in the morning or early afternoon since the heads could look creepy to some people.

Since this temple is hiding on the mountain slope, i would highly recommend everybody to rent a powered bicycle to bike from city through mountainous area (you can hike but it's really far from city). Also, due to distance, there's a lot less tourists around so you can take your time and enjoy the serene yet mysterious stone figures

A&J Echevarria,2018-04-11 13:35:49,5,1,"The best place to visit in Kyoto!  I‚Äôm a carver of Buddhist statues and this place surprised me beyond description.  To get to the front gate by bus, go to Daikaku-ji and transfer to the city bus that will take you to Kiyotaki.  Start your tour of Arashiyama here after visiting the temple and walk down the hill to Tenryu-ji.  95% of the tourists who go to Arashiyama don‚Äôt make it past the Torokko train station.  You‚Äôll have a quiet walk without tourists walking with their selfie sticks everywhere.  Also go to the town of Ohara to escape tourists and have a semi-rural experience.  Sanzen-In is the second best place to go.  Ignore all of this if you prefer crowds of tourists fighting for pictures that can be found on the internet.üë∫

There is also a bua stop right at the entrance of it. I recommend to visit.

Monserrat Rojo,2023-05-06 06:00:01,5,1,"A totally worth 30 minute walk from Arashiyama Bamboo Forest. The best about this temple is that it isn't as popular as other Kyoto spots. I got there by 8:30am and I had the whole place for me.

Philip Nalangan,2023-05-06 09:45:30,5,0,"This is the temple to go to if you hate crowded attractions. Super quiet, unlike other tourist attractions. I went there at 2pm and I only encountered about 10 tourists. It is also accessible by bus.

Rachel Quinto,2023-05-26 15:34:46,5,0,"This temple isn't usually featured in the top lists for temples to visit on Kyoto perhaps due to distance. However, if you want a temple that is less ""touched"" by tourism structures, this is it. You have the opportunity to go through the district Arashiyama and find more green and less people than the rest of the Kyoto temples. While the statues bring charm and draw to this temple, there are a lot more details and history that bring the spirituality and peace you may seek.

Notes: Recommend going early in the morning when it opens. Cash only admission. It is not a large temple, so easily can seen in less than 20 minutes unless you want to take your time to see all the details and individual statues.
