It is only in Japanese, but I was still captivated by the way the monk delivered the story. Quite off the beaten path, they don't seem to get many foreigners, but it was definitely worth the visit.

Trans-word plus TGM,2016-07-17 03:21:19,4,1,"Suzumushi Temple was built in 1723 by Saint Hotan. Its official name is Myotokuzan Kegon-ji. Suzumushi means crickets in English. Hotan was famous as a hard-working Buddhist monk. There is one sect of Buddhism called “Kegon,” but because of its strictness, the number of monks undertaking Kegon was decreasing and the religion was dying out. The situation prompted Hotan to try and revive Kegon. He studied Buddhism and philosophy widely and tried to spread Kegon to monks. It is also said that he was the first to make a world map which put India (the origin of Buddhism) at the center of the world. When he saw the map that Europeans brought to Japan, he just was compelled to create a new type of map. The map is very valuable historically.  Why don't you visit Matsuo Taisha Shrine on your way back to Katura station? It is only about 15 min walk. You will probably enjoy the rural atmosphere of this area. ( TGM Kyoto )",no,,view review

It costs 500 JPY as admission fee but worth of it. You can enter the Suzumushi room, hear the preach(in Japanese thou) and have some green tea.

Zakkuro Forest,2020-11-04 16:34:54,1,14,"Just another business-oriented temple with some clever ideas to make money. Very bad attitude to the visitors. You don’t feel the spirits and depth of a Buddhist temple there. Rude, arrogant, impatient and no compassion. The monk who gives the talk (preach) is repeating the same content to every group of visitors as if he were just a voice recorder.

I’m also skeptical about the way they breed the crickets. Why would a Buddhist temple do something like this that against the nature?

Do not go there if you do not understand Japanese - as it is compulsory to sit in the hall  to listen to the monk’s 30-minute talk first. It is the main part of the visit and what you are paying for, as there is nothing else to see in the temple (even the garden is just a small ordinary garden).  You are also NOT allowed to stroll around by yourself in the garden freely without listening to the talk first. And the talk is mainly advertisement about their talismans and also confectionery etc (as souvenirs) which their main purpose is to lure you to buy them after the talk (the talk itself is shallow and has nothing related to Buddha’s teaching unfortunately - which you can simply tell by the attitude of the monks there). Whenever you go or no matter how many times you visit, the content of the talk is the same.",no,,view review

I don't take preaching, so maybe it's okay to go without waiting in line
While everyone is lined up, the one who leaves from the side is
It's humanely difficult, and even if you're stingy with your profit,
If you feel comfortable, we recommend that you wait for the line to advance.

中田淳子,2021-09-30 03:42:12,4,26," First thing in the morning on weekdays, about a quarter of the seats were filled, and I knew it was my aim. About 10 minutes after it started, I snuck in. When I wondered where the bell cricket tape was spinning, the real thing was singing loudly in a glass case in front of me while eating an eggplant. Sit at the seat where sweets are on the kaishi and listen to the sermon. I guess from the story, there are quite a lot of greedy worshippers, probably because everyone comes to make a wish to Jizo. However, the chief priest is a master of discussion, suggesting how to deal with earthly desires, and telling stories that are not formal with jokes. Then stroll through the garden. Come to think of it, I was a bit shocked to hear that there are many customers who haven't even paid a visit to take pictures of the garden recently. I'm a thin person... I didn't want to make a wish too seriously, so I bought an amulet, headed to Jizo on the way home, worshiped, and left. By that time there was a queue. Asaichi recommended.

和風,2021-11-05 12:52:07,4,9," A popular spot in Kyoto.
I heard that you can listen to the priest's preaching that is full of humor and very helpful, so I visited here. I went on a weekday because it is said to be quite crowded on Saturdays and Sundays, but there were still many people lined up. The sermon seems to be held every hour until the evening.
Self-publishing, cleaning. do one's best!
It was my first experience listening to the chief priest's sermon at a temple, so I'm glad I was able to experience it. A Jizo statue wearing straw sandals is enshrined here, and is said to grant one wish. I hope it will come true.

山本高久,2021-11-12 12:53:48,5,29," It is famous for its temple of suzumushi, and throughout the year you can always hear the chirping of suzumushi (the sound of its wings). I'm able to go.
Kegon-ji Temple is not only about Suzumushi, but also the Kofuku Jizo Daibosatsu, a Jizo statue wearing straw sandals enshrined at the side of the temple gate. The Jizo statue that fulfills one wish is popular.
As for the parking lot, there is a parking lot of the temple at the side of the entrance stairs of Kegonji Temple, and it is 500 yen once. There is a paid parking lot in front of the approach, but it is a little far away, so it is convenient to use the parking lot of this temple. However, since there are only a little less than 20 units, it is not always possible to use them. However, there are about 80 stone steps to Kegonji Temple, and there are handrails, but I think it is difficult for those with disabilities to visit.
The entrance fee is 500 yen per person. The lucky charm is 300 yen.
Since it was founded in 1723 and will soon be celebrating its 300th anniversary, there are three types of limited-edition goshuin stamps (gold letters, 500 yen each) available for sale.
Also, in two and a half to three years from now, the guest room where I am currently listening to the sermon will be replaced with a guest room currently under construction on the other side of the stairs at the entrance of Kegonji Temple. The current guest room is a very pleasant environment, so I feel like it's quite a shame.

KORIMA,2022-01-06 01:08:39,5,225," Visited at the beginning of the preaching from 11 o'clock with good timing. I didn't know what kind of temple it was, so I didn't think that I would be able to listen to Mr. Gatsuri's story. For about 35 minutes, we listened to stories about Suzumushi Temple, Buddhism, and how to use amulets and amulets. Mr. Osho's sermon was not a straight talk, but the time flew by because he was listening to a vaudeville.

It is said that Jizo statues wearing straw sandals will come to fulfill your wishes.

The method is
① I have only one wish.
(2) While holding the amulet in your hand (the character “happiness” is the face of Jizo, so don’t hide it).
③ At this time, be sure to tell us your address and name.

On the way back, everyone bought amulets and amulets, prayed to Jizo, and left. You can also buy it for friends and family far away. (Please do the same in the direction of Suzumushi Temple in Kyoto.)

The staff at the temple were also very kind.
May all your wishes come true 🙏

I walked from Kamikatsura Station, but there is a signboard on the way to Suzumushi Temple, so I can go smoothly without getting lost.
I used it twice in the past, and both times my wishes came true!

The worship fee is 500 yen.
Osho-san will talk about 30 minutes.

X,2022-03-06 04:39:50,4,23," Suzumushi Temple is on the way back from Moss Temple.
I took the opportunity to drop by.
When I arrived at 12:05, the security guard at the bicycle parking lot explained to me that there was a lecture at 12:00, so I could enter until 12:10, so I rushed up the stairs.

I paid 500 yen without knowing the reason, and was guided to a large hall.
Many people were already seated, and tea cakes were placed on the table.
I slipped in the middle of the sermon, but it was 12:07, so it seems that the first half of the sermon was over.

When I took a break and listened, the children from other places ended their sermons early! was making noise.
I laughed while thinking that it was so from a child.
I thought I could hear the sound of bell crickets, but I actually had a lot of bell crickets.
Cut eggplants are skewered, and countless crickets are placed in a lit-up cage.
I don't know why it's a bellworm.

After listening to the preaching and leaving the temple, there is a spot where you can overlook Kyoto from a corner of the precincts.
good view.

After that, there was a goshuin hut on the way.
According to the chief priest, when you pray, you should remember your name and address, but I completely forgot and just made a wish.

It was 12:33 at that time, but during that time, about 30 people were lined up on the stone steps, and I didn't know that the temple was so popular...

And I still don't understand why I paid 500 yen.
Even though I didn't want to listen to a sermon, I just found out later that it was popular for the time being.

From the station, go to Taisha Shrine, turn left at the torii ⛩, turn left in front of Tsukiyomisha, then turn right at the sign for Suzumushi-dera Temple. Feel free to use the map as well. It is safe because you can sit up to about 100 people waiting until the time comes on the stairs. The gentle Jizo statue is right in front of the gate! It seems that it will be relocated in a few years, so I am greedy and impatient. The Peace Treaty was fun and the ""bitter label"" was the best. Jizo looked like a cute smiling woman.

The sermon was humorous and easy to understand, and the time flew by. There was a lot of greenery, and I felt cooler than in the sunlight.
I wondered why there were so many people who came just to hear the story of the chief priest. I also remember hearing the chief priest's story and feeling lighter.

マッシー,2022-07-08 06:02:55,5,7," I visited Suzumushi Temple for the first time in the hot and humid afternoon of July 6 (Wednesday), which I had always wanted to visit. The admission fee is 500 yen and includes a 30-minute sermon and sweets. Visit Matsuo Taisha, which I visited 45 years ago, then Tsukiyomi Shrine, and then head to Suzumushi Temple. Walk along the signboard, go down the narrow road, pass the soba restaurant, and there is a staircase on the right. When I went up, I arrived in front of the gate where a gentle Jizo was standing. The time was around 2:20 pm and I waited for a while until the sermon started at 3:00 pm. I was in front of the gate. Around 2:40, about 20 people who had finished the 2:00 p.m. sermon and prayers left. Many people made wishes to Jizo.
When the time came, I was taken and disinfected, and I was guided to a large guest room, and tea sweets were placed on the table. The sound of bell crickets is ringing. It seems that there are about 5,000 bell crickets in many lit-up cages with cut eggplants on skewers.
So I listened to stories about Suzumushi Temple, Buddhism, and wishes. It wasn't a formal talk, but it felt like I was listening to a yose, and the time flew by. The preaching from 3:00 pm was about 30 people, and there were quite a few young couples, and a little later, there was also a female junior high school student on a school excursion. The air conditioning worked well and it was cool.
After listening to the sermon, when I left the temple, there was a spot where I could see Kyoto from a corner of the precincts, and I could see Kyoto Tower. There was a goshuin hut on the way. I visited the main hall. After that, I made a wish to Jizo-san.
It is said that Jizo statues wearing straw sandals will come to fulfill your wishes.
According to the chief priest, the way to do this is to give your name and address and make a wish. Make only one wish while holding the amulet in your hand (the character for “happiness” is the face of Jizo, so don’t hide it). The staff at the temple were also very kind.

Omotesando has 80 steps, but the passage I took this time has about 40 steps, and there is a stone-paved slope along the way. As I was walking slowly, a concerned person from the temple office came to see me.
After about 10 minutes, the sermon had already started, but they prepared a chair for me in the last row, so I was able to start reading from the end of Suzumushi no Origin Bushi.

Visited during summer vacation.
It was past 12:00 and there was a line up to the bottom of the stairs.

Is it possible to just look around the precincts? I was thinking, but it was a visit that included a sermon.

Can we accommodate about 100 people at one time?
In the air-conditioned rooms, which are kept at the September temperature all year round, crickets hum all year round.
It's a tatami room, but they seem to prepare a chair for those with bad knees.

The story of the chief priest was very good, and it ended in a blink of an eye.
When the sermon is over, go around the precincts and go to the temple gate.

Finally, I would like to ask Jizo-sama.
There is no need to wait in line until everyone is finished.
The guide said that it was enough to see Jizo's face.
If it's crowded, it won't end.

I was nervous about entering the 10 o'clock section, but I managed to slip in!

Sweets on the cushion!
Heart of hospitality ☺️
Take it home because it's in this day and age ♡

Then, for about 30 minutes, the chief priest's humorous and thankful story, and the thankful Jizo-sama who listens to your wishes ♡
It is said that the Jizo wears sandals and goes around various places to fulfill the wishes of those who ask for it! ! 🥰

terrible! I hammered into my head the new address I hadn't remembered, and made a request to Jizo-sama😊

A lot of Suzumushi seems to be bred so that they can hear the tone all year round! very!

However, unfortunately, the main hall of the temple will be demolished soon because it is a sediment disaster danger area🥲
It seems that the new mido will be rebuilt in a slightly lower open place!
It's a shame because it's a historical temple! I'm glad I went in the end! !
We were looking for donations for the rebuilding of the rich! If you have made a wish to Jizo, please pay your respects and pay your respects as soon as possible!

Now you can also get a commemorative goshuin!
It's sparkling and lovely ☺️

It is known as a temple where crickets are raised throughout the year and sermons are given to the sound of the crickets.
The tale of Kofuku Jizo, who wears straw sandals and is said to grant one wish, is explained in an easy-to-understand manner to soften the hearts of visitors.
The breeze from the garden of the temple adds a sense of healing, and after the sermon, I felt that there are various ways to spend time, such as receiving the amulet of Kofuku Jizoson and looking at the garden, after visiting the stone steps. When I went down, I was surprised at the long line of people who wanted to visit.
The moss temple in the suburbs was not possible to visit because it was a reservation system.

Photography is prohibited inside the building. I have asked several times.

If you visit many temples in one day, they are very similar, so most of the time the names do not appear. So if you're in the Arashiyama area, I think it's fun to head to Arashiyama Station from this Kegonji Temple, nearby Saihoji Temple (advance reservation required) and Matsuo Taisha Shrine, each with a different personality.

It takes about 4 hours to leisurely look around these three. However, please keep in mind that there are many cases where you have to wait for an hour at this Suzumushi Temple. 4 hours including waiting time.

First, listen to the voice of Suzumushi while listening to the sermon from the chief priest about making a wish.
He speaks softly and makes me laugh!
Listen to the preaching, walk around the garden, visit the principal image, and finally make a wish to the Jizo.
If you arrive at the temple when the previous audience has finished, you can enter right away (I think about 60 people can fit in at one time), but if the previous episode hasn't finished, you'll have to wait quite a while.
In addition, the total tour time is about one hour, including the preaching and the waiting time to buy the amulet, so it is recommended that you visit with plenty of time to spare.
(I feel like I didn't have enough time and it was a waste.)
During the garden tour, many people walk along the narrow road, so if you want to take your time, it is better to take your time at the reception hall where you will listen to the sermon, then go to the end of the line and take a leisurely look. I think it's good.

Unlike ordinary temple worship, about 100 worshipers are allowed to enter every hour or so on a rotating basis, and when you enter, you will be guided to a tatami room with many crickets. Then I will listen to a sermon for about 30 minutes, but this is a fun story and I listen intently.
At the exit of the tatami room, you can receive bills and amulets, but I didn't understand the rules and I didn't know the amount, so I was a little flustered. You may need to check the rules of worship in advance.
That's why it's 3 stars.
