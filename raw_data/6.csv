Half hour later I realize the loss of purse and rushed back to this temple. Blessings by Holy Buddha, with the help of staff in temple, they returned me my purse with passport in it. But a decent amount of money missed. This is a bitter sweet experience. I should be so grateful to recover the passport, but I really want to tell the person who took the money as following: if you are in this temple, you are already in path of searching spiritual peace. Money present big temptation for weak soul, and by taking away the money that does not belong to you, you add burden to your life. Today is a raining day, I learned big lesson here.",no,,view review

This on the other hand is also what makes it difficult to access. You get no signs in anything but Japanese and no information.  The place is small and it is worth spending 20 minutes here.

The Amida Sanzon seated statue was a very powerful Buddha statue with countless Buddha statues on the halo of Amida. There were other unique Buddha statues and Arhat figures, so there were no people, so I was impressed to see such a wonderful temple treasure in a chartered state. Next, I visited the main hall and was impressed by the unique appearance of the principal image.

Â••ÊùëÊÖé‰πüÔºàOK computerÔºâ,2020-06-08 12:04:52,4,4," Seiryoji is a Jodo sect temple located in Saga, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. The mountain name is called Godaisan. Known as Saga Shakado, it has also been known as the 'Yutsu Nenbutsu Dojo' since the Middle Ages. The sect was first Kegon sect, and later Jodo sect. The principal image is Shaka Nyorai, the founder is Tatsun, and the founder is his disciple, Josan.
The history of this temple involves two temples, Seikaji, whose principal image is the Amida Sanzon, and Seiryoji, whose principal image is Shaka Nyorai. In this area, there was originally the villa Seikakan of Emperor Saga's son Minamoto no Toru (822-895), the Minister of the Left. In 896, the first anniversary of Minamoto no Toru's death, his son created the Amida Sanzon statue, which Toru made a wish to build but could not fulfill, and called the Amida-do Hall Seika-ji Temple where it was enshrined. After that, in the 8th year of Tenkei (945), Princess Shigeaki built a new hall and enshrined a life-sized statue of Shaka. According to one theory, the name 'Shakado' originated at this time.
A few decades after the founding of Seikaji Temple, there was a monk from Todaiji Temple called Chonen (‚ÄúChonen‚Äù 938-1016) who traveled to Song dynasty China and made a pilgrimage to Mt. In 985, while traveling to Song, Xian ordered a local Buddhist sculptor to engrave a statue of Shaka Nyorai at Kaiyuan Temple in Taizhou. The Buddha statue is a copy of a spiritual statue with a history that King Uden of ancient India had him make from sandalwood during his lifetime. Because it was handed down, it is called 'the Buddha statue of the three kingdoms', and it is called 'the living Buddha' because it is a living copy of the Buddha. After returning to Japan in the first year of Eien (987), Tetsunen likened Mt. Atago in Kyoto to Mt. He tried to build a temple to enshrine the current National Treasure. By enshrining the statue of Shakyamuni, which was introduced from the Three Kingdoms, in this land of Saga, it is believed that Gonen intended to make it the center of the old Buddhist capital of the Nanto system. In other words, by building Seiryo-ji Temple as a base at the foot of Mt. Atago, which rises to the northwest of the capital, it is said that the intention was to compete with Enryaku-ji Temple on Mt. . However, he was opposed by Enryaku-ji Temple and died in 1016 without fulfilling his wish. Godaisan Seiryo-ji Temple was built in the precincts of Seika-ji Temple by Josan, a disciple who inherited his will.

It was after 1279 that the connection with Yuzu Nenbutsu was established. In this year, Engaku, who is called Dainenbutsu Chuko Shonin, practices Yuzu Nenbutsu at this temple. After that, Dainenbutsu became popular at this temple, and it became a training hall for Yuzu Nenbutsu. It is said that the Saga Dai Nenbutsu was performed for the first time in 1443. After that, the main temple was destroyed by fire during the Onin War, but it was rebuilt in 1481.

In 1530, Enyo entered this temple and practiced Nenbutsu at 12 o'clock for the first time, and this temple became a temple of the Jodo sect. Shakado (main hall) was donated and built by Toyotomi Hideyori in 1602, but after that, the Great Fire of Saga spread, and the temple below the main hall was damaged, and the temple was also damaged by a major earthquake. will be severely damaged.
As mentioned above, the Buddha statue in this temple was made in China in the 10th century, but since the Middle Ages, it is believed that this statue is not a copy but a sandalwood Buddha statue brought from India. [1]. In response to this faith, from 1700, the dekaicho to various places, starting from Edo, began. In addition, at the request of Keishoin, the mother of Tsunayoshi Tokugawa, the temple was rebuilt. In this way, the statue of Shaka, which was handed down from the Three Kingdoms, gained faith, and Seiryo-ji Temple prospered and was called 'Saga no Shaka-do.' On the other hand, Seika-ji Temple, which was the original temple, gradually declined, but the Amida-do hall and the Amida Sanzon statue (a national treasure, currently enshrined in the Reihokan) still retain their remnants.

At first glance, it looks like the temple gate and main hall (Shaka-do), which are splendid but not unusual in Kyoto, and a similar number of halls lined up, but the Shaka Nyorai statue, a national treasure, is enshrined in the shrine inside Shaka-do. And the garden at the back of Shakado is wonderful. In spring and autumn, the treasure hall is opened to the public, and treasures such as the Amida Triad, which is a national treasure, are exhibited. I would also like you to take a look at these. Compared to Tenryu-ji Temple, which is also located in Saga-Arashiyama, the precincts are quieter, but the quality and quantity of cultural properties are not inferior.
If you're tired of the crowds around Randen Arashiyama Station, it's a good idea to take your time and visit here.

Kongoh Shun,2020-12-06 07:27:45,5,10," After walking around Arashiyama, I was thinking about stopping by a temple, and I've been to famous places in the area.

When I read the reviews, I heard that there are national treasures and important cultural properties, so I decided to go there.

It turned out great.

First, Niomon. As you walk along the street in front of the gate, you will see it, but you will be impressed by its old and splendid appearance.

The National Treasures and Important Cultural Properties that were specially exhibited at the Reihokan were wonderful.

You will be amazed at the power and beauty of the Amida Buddha, which imitates the face of Minamoto no Toru, who is said to have modeled Hikaru Genji in The Tale of Genji.

Monju and Fugen Bodhisattva are also wonderful. The colors are still there and it reminds me of the splendor of the past.

I bought a postcard because I couldn't take pictures. By all means, please check the splendor with your own eyes. The real thing is many times better than the picture on the postcard.

It's a pity that it can only be seen at the spring and autumn special exhibitions. Wonderful Buddhas that should be open to the public throughout the year.

The treasure hall is open to the public in spring (April and May) and autumn (October and November).

S Mura,2022-09-24 09:25:49,5,3," The principal image of Buddha, which is too beautiful, is wonderful, but you can also see the garden from the hall where you paid the viewing fee and go out to the corridor leading to the back garden. You can't go down to the garden, but it was a very nice garden. There was no one else around when I was there, and I wondered if it was okay to have such a wonderful place all to myself on such a sunny day.

‰∫ïÈáéÂè£KEIGENN,2022-11-08 10:06:24,5,0," A treasure trove of Buddhist statues in Arashiyama.
The Reihokan, which is open to the public in spring and autumn, displays important cultural properties such as the national treasure Amida Sanzon, the Four Heavenly Kings, and the Ten Great Disciples.
The principal image of the main hall, the Seiryoji-shiki Shaka Nyorai, is also open to the public on a limited basis. I can.
There are ginkgo trees and autumn leaves in the precincts, and the area around the main hall, the Tahoto pagoda, and the sutra storehouse are beautifully colored during the autumn leaves season.
There is a parking lot, but a parking fee is required.
I think the easiest way to visit is to go to Saga Shakado-mae by public transportation ""City Bus"".
You can also walk from Saga Arashiyama, but be careful as there are a lot of cars.

There are many things to see at any time, such as the large precincts and Hojo garden, but we especially recommend visiting in April, May, October and November when the National Treasure Shaka Nyorai statue and the National Treasure Amida Sanzon statue are open to the public.

At the time when it was renamed Seiryo-ji Temple, it was a combined school of the Kegon, Tendai, and Shingon sects, but later it also served as the Nenbutsu (Pure Land) sect and is now a Jodo sect temple. The buildings in the precincts are reconstructions of the Edo period. The Niomon is a magnificent two-story standing figure, and the main hall is also large. There is also Toyotomi Hideyori's head mound next to the main hall.

One of Kyoto's three major kyogen, Saga Shakado's 3 parts, ``Shaka Nyorai'', ``Daikokugari'' and ``Tsuchigumo'' were performed, so I saw them all.
Like Kyogen? There is laughter, and the last performance of ""Tsuchigumo"" is powerful? There is also a ‚Äúvertical‚Äù, and it is worth seeing.

Maboo Nakano,2023-03-20 07:30:04,4,0," I took a detour to take a short break after walking around the foothills of Kitasaga. The first thing that caught my eye when I entered the court was the Kawazu cherry blossoms and the crowd of people. Unexpectedly, I also joined. After that, I took a leisurely stroll.
This Seiryo-ji Temple is now a temple of the Jodo sect of Buddhism and began as the villa of Gentou in The Tale of Genji.The Shaka-do Hall of Seika-ji Temple enshrined the statue of Shakyamuni Buddha brought back from the Song Dynasty and is commonly known as Saga-Shakado Hall. admired by It used to be the Yamashita Betto-ji Temple of Atago Hakuun-ji Temple (Atago-jinja Shrine), so it seems to have become the starting point of the Atago Highway.

Well...the inside of the temple is quite large, so please allow yourself some time to look around.

Jun Nishida,2023-04-26 11:11:17,4,0," I visited Saga Dainenbutsu Kyogen, which was held for the first time in three years.
The cherry blossoms were in full bloom and there were a lot of people around Arashiyama, but when I came to this area, people were sparse. However, I think that everyone was looking forward to the performance because it was full of people in front of the Kyogen Hall. It was my first time to see Saga Dainenbutsu Kyogen, but each performance has its own unique world view and makes me want to see all of them.
Since it was a kyogen for the common people, the banquet guests were allowed to come down and take pictures.

Ben Hsu,2023-05-03 09:50:33,5,2,"Seiry≈ç-ji, a Buddhist temple, in Arashiyama section of Kyoto, retains Japanese Buddhism culture and tradition. The temple seems to have long history with Chinese Buddhism by going back to Chinese Tang Dynasty of the 7th century, and its Buddhist artifice collection in the main hall seems to document its close tie with Chinese and Indian Buddhism.

Because it is NOT located at Arashiyama train station, bridge, or bamboo glove areas, which are more popular and known for the tourists, its about 10-minute walking distance from Arashiyama train station actually offers it an unique Buddhist serenity and quietness without much noise or loud talking of the tourists.

The rear area of the temple, which requires moderate admission fee to enter, exhibits Buddhist practice- including sitting, writing- building design and architect, and chatting and learning with and from Buddhist Masters who are friendly and patient. The rear section of the temple has an unique traditional wooden walkway to connect the front main hall. The rear section of the temple also has unique but tranquil garden of flower trees and moss on the garden floor.

The rear-garden Zen or sitting worship room offers worshipers for writing Buddhism pray or so called NO-evil behaviors pledges, and worshipers are allowed to leave their writing in the front of the worship room, with or without donations, and monks will pray for the believers,

During Chinese Cultural Revolution and, later, Kyoto University College Revolt [in 1969], many Japanese universities, including Kyoto University, had wide-spread student unrest on campus which caused campus lock-up. Because of his academic relations with various religious and history scholars of Kyoto University, Master Monk of Seiryo-ji Temple, who was a famous history scholar, offered help to foreign visiting scholars to Kyoto University for temporary residence in the temple.

In April, Seiryo-ji Temple will have its annual tradition for traditional drama show to represent the kick off of traditional Japanese drama season.

The Temple also holds two times per year for its collection of  Buddhist art, mainly 10th century statutes,  and generally it is held and open for the  visitors in April and Oct-Nov. The admission is 300 yen in 2018.

Staff at the front reception or admission office do know some foreign language, including English, and they are willing to help visitors by hand signs or other measures.  Some of the staffs are volunteers, including cleaning workers.

While temple is serene and peaceful overall,  visitors can feel that strong sense of humanity and classic wooden building walkway in the rear garden of the temple. In rear garden, visitors can also write visiting impression and reflection on the visitors books.  Visitors can also write their ""Promise for Doing Goodness"" and make special prayer or wish on the Japanese tatami Zen practice or sitting worship room which has Buddha image in the front center.  The Zen practice room provides a rare seclusion for relaxation and reflection with quietness, when Arashiyama is becoming more and more crowded with noise.

The temple's simple but beautiful garden has cherry blossom trees and other flower trees in Spring and In Autumn.

Visitors coming out the temple's main gate may want to turn left and stop by at the Japanese bean curd store which is one of the Kyoto's oldest bean curd makers and which always has numerous home town buyers from Kyoto for its daily fresh-make bean curds. Tourists can also buy and try the just-make bean curd at the store.

Walking to Seiryo-ji Temple is about 6 to 8 minutes of walking distance from JR Arishiyama train station or Keifuku [Randen] Line Arashiyama train station.

I was surprised to be able to go to the second floor. On the left and right sides of the gate were vermillion Aun statues. It was difficult to take pictures. It was early in the morning, and I often saw locals stop by before going to work (?) and put their hands together. I thought it was an important temple.
