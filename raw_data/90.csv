Also, it seems that it is a temple for Shugendo and Yamabushi, so I was looking for a walking tour with Yamabushi. I don't think there is any other place where you can see fusuma paintings that are the handwriting of the Kano school from a close distance. I felt that the admission fee of 800 yen was too cheap.

七面鳥放浪記,2018-10-10 16:27:16,4,1," Although it is a historic temple with ties to the imperial family, it is not well known, and is easily mistaken for a confectioner. However, as one would expect from the head temple of the Shugen sect, the Kano school wall paintings that are open to the public during special visits in the spring and autumn are spectacular.
Since it is the 18th temple of the Kinki 36 Fudo, you can freely visit the main hall even outside the special viewing period (free of charge). The statue of Fudo Myo-o, the principal image of worship, is a national important cultural property. In the building, the Shoin is designated as an important cultural property of the country. The garden in front of the Shinden is well maintained, but when you look from the Shinden, you can't help but see the building on the other side of the wall. It is recommended to look at the Shinden from the garden.

The regular visit is worth it, but the partition paintings here are worth taking your time to enjoy, so we recommend a special visit.

It's not that big now, but the beautifully swept garden and the fusuma paintings by the Kano school are all wonderful.
Since it is called Honzan Shugendo, there are many statues of Fudo Myo-o, and you can see the Fudo-san in the main hall right in front of you.
During the autumn special opening, the temple staff will guide you every 30 minutes, so you can learn more about it.

In the case of the Great Fire of Tenmei, when the palace burns down, it may be natural to expect that there will be plenty of treasures if Emperor Kokaku's refuge is a temporary imperial palace for Emperor Komyo...

A paid course of 800 yen, a short course to the main hall and the shinden is explained for about 30 minutes, and the tatami mats at this time are cold. Bring thick socks. As expected, people who are accustomed to the tour can quickly leave and go to the free course.

There are works that can be photographed and works that cannot be photographed, and there is also a dry landscape garden. Until the Meiji era, there was a village of Shogoin in the west, and it seems that there was a forest. The autumn leaves of this forest are beautiful like brocade, and it is called ""Kinrin"", and it is said that Yatsuhashi and radish were grown. Talking about the Yatsuhashi lawsuit?

Fudo Myoo can also be seen, but 80% of the whole is fusuma painting. Recommended only for those who are interested in the Kano school or the Hasegawa school✋

山田大雅,2021-12-05 06:09:40,4,3," In 1090, Emperor Shirakawa went on a pilgrimage to Kumano, and the person who guided him was a Buddhist monk named Zoyo.
Zoyo led the ascetics scattered throughout the Kii mountain range, and made Emperor Shirakawa's pilgrimage to Kumano a success.
Emperor Shirakawa was impressed by Zoyo's leadership and decided to build a temple for him. That is Shogoin.
At the same time, Emperor Shirakawa organized Shugendo, which had been worshiped in various temples at the time, around this temple. At that time, there were Tendai-style Shugendo and Shingon-style Shugendo, but they were all gathered at this temple. As a result, Shogoin gained the status of the central temple of Shugendo.
Later, in the Edo period, an incident occurred in Awaji Island in which a Tendai-style ascetic practiced slashing a Shingon-style ascetic.
Taking this incident as an opportunity, the shogunate divided Shugendo, which had gathered at Shogoin Temple, into Tendai and Shingon. In other words, the Tendai school was left in Shogo-in Temple as it was and became the 'Honzan school', while the Shingon school was moved to Daigoji Sanboin and divided into the 'Tozan school'.
Since then, Shogoin has become the head temple of Tendai Shugendo.
When Shugendo was ordered to be abolished in the Meiji period, Shogoin became a temple of the Tendaijimon sect, with Onjoji as its head temple.
When the abolition of Shugendo was lifted after the war, Shogoin returned to the temple of Shugendo and continues to this day.

We saw the statues of Fudo Myo-o (Important Cultural Property) and En no Gyoja statues (Maeki, Goki, Hachidai Doji), which are the principal images of the temple, and were shown around the rooms in the Shinden and the Kinpeki partition paintings.
``Shogo-in'' is the head temple of the Shugen sect of Buddhism, and was also called ``Shogo-in monzeki'' or ``Kinrin-fu''. It belonged to the Tendai sect Jimon sect (Tendaiji Daishu) and was one of the three monzeki temples.
The principal image of worship is the standing statue of Fudo Myo-o, accompanied by the two-child statue, which is said to have been made in the late Heian period and has been designated as a national important cultural property.
Shogo-in Temple was founded in 1090 by Zoyo Daiso, who served as a mentor to Emperor Shirakawa's Kumano Goyuki. to start.
After being destroyed by fire during the Onin War, it was rebuilt by Cloistered Imperial Prince Dokan in 1666.
Since the Cloistered Imperial Prince Shizue (son of Emperor Goshirakawa) entered this temple as a shrine monzeki, it boasts a high status as a monzeki temple where the Cloistered Imperial Princes have entered the temple for generations.
Shogo-in is currently the central temple of the Honzan sect of Shugendo in Japan, and is the head temple that oversees Kasumi throughout the country.
After the abolition of Shugendo was issued in 1872, it belonged to the Tendaijimon sect for a period of time, but in 1946 it returned to the Shugen sect and became independent, later changing its name to the Honzan Shugen sect. However, until now, even when it belonged to the Jimon school of the Tendai sect for a period of time, the temple status of ""Shogo-in"" remained the same as Ohonzan.

It is said that the anti-Buddhism movement in the Meiji period was the rejection of Shugendo. The characteristics of Shugendo, which incorporates Taoism, Buddhism, Shintoism, and all other religions, were wary of the imperial court as a dangerous idea.

In 1613, the Tokugawa shogunate also promulgated Shugendo, dividing the national ascetic asceticism into the Honzan sect of Shogo-in Temple and the Tozan sect of Daigo Sanbo-in Temple, and monitoring them.

In other words, Shogo-in Temple is the central temple of the Honzan School of Shugendo in Japan, and is also the head temple that oversees Kasumi throughout the country. After the abolition of Shugendo was issued in 1872 (Meiji 5), it temporarily belonged to the Tendaijimon sect, but in 1946 (Showa 21) it became independent again as the Shugen sect (later the Honzan Shugen sect) and continues to this day. increase. Even after it belonged to the Tendai sect, the status of Shogo-in Temple was Daihonzan.

It is also the birthplace of Shogoin Yatsuhashi, a Japanese confectionery, and Shogoin radish, Shogoin turnip, and Shogoin cucumber, which are Kyoto vegetables. Before the introduction of modern medicine, Shugendo was prepared and sold by Shugen practitioners.
