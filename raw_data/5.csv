Dave MacLachlan,2015-04-10 03:10:51,4,0,Small temple. Beautiful moss gardens. I bet it looks gorgeous in the fall when the maple leafs give it some color.

Be wary that Google Maps sends you the wrong way around 'the block' and you cannot get in from the north dead end road.

Melanie Yong,2017-09-02 06:09:55,4,2,"The moss garden was beautiful and unlike any other temple I've went in Kyoto (and I went most of them). It's very small, and if you're early there (good to pair with bamboo grove early and walk the distance over here), you get the small temple to yourself (no pictures!), which is a good rest to be calm and peaceful.

Purchasing it with the paired ticket with another temple is a good affordable choice, as this area of town is very scenic and serene on a quiet day for a walking tour (local map is provided at this temple).

Price 300yen
This place feels almost magical. Beautiful moss garden with the most fantastic looking trees that almost form a roof over the garden. Very few people. If you get here early in a day that isn't very busy you might be able to get the place to yourself.
If you in any shape or form like moss gardens then THIS is the place to go. The temple isn't anything to write home about, the garden is the main attraction
The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because you are not able to get a Goshuin painted in your book, you can only buy pieces of paper seperately. It is a pretty Goshuin though.
