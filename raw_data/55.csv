There's just a very small though lovely garden. The rest is closed to the public. It might prove tricky to find due to the lack of English signs after some point.

It's a small temple but yet, very serene, tranquil and it seems like, all is at peace with the soul. Very mystical indeed and definitely worth a visit!
