Jozan Ishikawa was a master of Chinese poetry and calligraphy, and spent 31 years in this thatched thatched hut. It is said that literati (persons who excelled in learning and virtue) at the time had an admiration for China and used Chinese landscape paintings as models. There are portraits of 36 Chinese poets (Kano Shinrei) and a poem by Jozan, so please take a look first.

On the other hand, the garden, which is covered with white sand, is beautiful in every season, with plum blossoms in March and cherry blossoms in May. Of course, it will appear in the 30 selections of famous gardens.

You can change into zori and take a walk in the garden. There are ""Shishiodoshi"" for animals that damage the fields, waterfalls, streams, etc. There is also a cute monk on the mountain of seasonal flowers and moss.

I asked the lady at the reception on the way home. what is that flower

It is adjacent to Hachidai Shrine, which is famous for the duel between Miyamoto Musashi and Yoshioka clan Ichijoji Sagarimatsu. This is a thatched hut built by Jozan Ishikawa, a close aide of Ieyasu Tokugawa, as his retirement home. The name of the temple is derived from the fact that Lord Jozan chose 36 Chinese poets, had Tanyu Kano draw their portraits, and personally wrote the poetry of each poet in ink on a plaque and hung it between the poets. The precincts are designated as a national historic site, and the Chinese-style garden that Jozan likes is particularly spectacular. Standing in the garden, the sound of the deer that echoes in the silence will make you feel dignified. The cherry blossoms in May and the autumn leaves in November are especially famous.

Enter through a small entrance made of bamboo. I confirmed with the receptionist that you can freely take pictures both inside and outside the building (garden).

The founder, Jozan Ishikawa, was a samurai who served the Tokugawa family, and was a man who achieved success in the Osaka Summer Siege. It is a person who studied junior high school. He is a master of clerical books and Chinese poetry, and the founder of sencha.
There were no large, intimidating buildings on the grounds, but rather a carefully landscaped garden surrounding a small pond.

I was able to sit in a large tatami room and enjoy the green maple leaves outside for a while.

You can put on the provided slippers and go outside to take a walk in the garden. There is a shishiodoshi in the garden, and the occasional clattering of bamboo shoots echoes through the garden, making it even more tranquil. I will also attach a video of Shishiodoshi.

keiko hoihoi,2022-11-08 02:53:50,5,1," Go deeper into Ichijoji Sagarimatsu, the site of the Musashi duel. The highlight is the Japanese garden, so it's a spot you'll want to visit not just once, but in different seasons to enjoy the beautiful nature of each season. In 1986, Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana also visited.
The man who built it, Jozan Ishikawa, was a former samurai who had served the Tokugawa since he was 16 years old, a master of Chinese poetry, and a superman who is said to be the founder of sencha. Originally an academically talented man, he retired at the age of 33 and built this place at the age of 59 while studying Shugaku and Zen. In short, Jozan's house after retirement. A versatile man who was also talented as a gardener.
Jozan was particularly good at learning about China, and the name Shisen-do comes from the ``Shisen-no-ma'', where portraits of 36 Chinese poets are displayed after the 36 Immortals of Japan. It is generally called ``Shisen-do'', but the correct name is ``Jozan-ji'', a temple of the Soto sect of Buddhism in China.
Considering the average life expectancy at that time was short, he seems to have lived a long life (89 years old). Did you know the secret to longevity, or was it the healing power of nature? It was a Shisen-do temple that seems to be beneficial for longevity.

Ichiro Koromonotana,2023-01-22 08:23:10,5,2," Shisendo has a very high reputation for being a good place. I visited in the autumn when the leaves had passed. A light beam slanted slightly to the west shone through the silence, creating a somewhat soft atmosphere. About 400 years ago, Jozan Ishikawa, who served Ieyasu Tokugawa, lived in this area, and its beautiful appearance remains today.
I asked my friend Kano Tanyu to paint a portrait of a Chinese poet, and just being in the space where I would have lived while looking at it, various imaginations come to my mind as to what kind of life I might have had. .
The garden has heights, and depending on the location, the building is hidden by the garden trees, and there are places where it feels like it is out in the mountains, giving the impression that it has a wide variety of faces.
I would definitely like to visit in other seasons as well, such as fresh greenery, various flowers, and autumn leaves.

y kubo („Åó„Å£„ÅΩ„Åè),2023-04-18 13:31:59,5,0," It's a good place, so I don't really want to teach it, to be honest.
The admission fee of 500 yen is cheap.
I don't think it's strange to set the price three times in spring and autumn (personal impression).
I want you to go and feel what is good.
If you want information before that, I think you should search for it.

K K,2023-05-06 05:36:02,5,0," It is a sightseeing spot in Ichijoji. If you get off at Ichijoji Station on the Eizan Electric Railway and head west, there is a ramen shop, but if you walk east for about 15 minutes, you will find Shisendo. There are several spots called Shisendo, and this is a spot called Shisendo in Jozanji Temple.
Shisendo is quiet and you can feel the sounds of nature. You can go up inside and enjoy the sounds of nature while relaxing. Shishiodoshi is especially soothing. When sightseeing in Kyoto, take a rest at Shisendo and feel the nature.

B C,2023-05-28 15:27:57,5,1," I went on a holiday, but there were quite a lot of people. However, since it is located on the outskirts of Kyoto city, there is plenty of room to sit and look at the garden.
Impression that there were many people taking pictures.
Shisen-do can park motorcycles and cars, so it's helpful. The receptionist was kind and made a good impression.

shin in,2023-06-01 09:59:28,4,0," It is said that Jozan Ishikawa, a vassal of Ieyasu, used to live in seclusion. It is said that there is a Shisen-no-ma, where the statues of 36 Chinese poets drawn by Kano Tanyu are displayed. The Chinese style garden shines even in this fresh green season.
There was also Enkoji Temple nearby, so it wasn't too crowded, so I was able to enjoy it leisurely.
May in the photo of this year's calendar that I own is ""Shisen-do's garden"".

13 ciervo,2023-06-14 22:18:18,4,0," Since my last visit was in late autumn, the leaves on the trees had withered and the garden was drab.
This time, when I visited during the fresh green season, my impression was completely different. The azaleas were past their peak, but the irises, blue maples, and moss covering the artificial hill were vivid and beautiful.
Now, after taking off your shoes and sitting down to appreciate the dry landscape garden, you can later put on your own shoes and take a walk around the garden below.
The impression changes depending on the season, so you will want to visit several times.

ÂãùZi,2023-06-17 08:10:44,5,1," On the way to Tanukidaniyama Fudoin, everyone entered as if they were sucked in. If you look closely, it says Shisen-do. I've heard that if you pay 500 yen to enter, you'll find yourself in a wonderful garden. It's not that big, but it's a compact garden, and it's very atmospheric with the thumping sound of the deer. Perhaps this garden is a garden where you can enjoy the scenery of spring, summer, autumn and winter. I would like to see a different face of Shisendo again in autumn.
