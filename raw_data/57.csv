Eric Dallemagne,2017-08-25 06:55:15,5,5,"The Eikan-do temple was my favorite in Kyoto. Although it is known for its spectacular grounds being colored by the autumn leaves, we visited it during the summer. It was still very pretty; there was a wonderful harmony among the beautiful architecture, the pond and the garden. It was so peaceful and calm. Just absolutely gorgeous.

At the top, there was a pagoda that gave us a view of the entire city of Kyoto.

Fees are low and overall a relaxing experience.

Toni Laurén,2018-03-11 16:45:14,5,1,"Spring time, before April, this temple looked absolutely beautiful. Rooms included many paintings with English background info and statues and relics also had English infos. This place closed at 5pm but last customers were taken in at 4pm. I recommend coming here just few hours before sunset so the light will make this place even more peaceful.

Magdalena F,2018-03-31 01:00:59,5,0,"Temple is beautiful and relaxing. I've been here twice and I am planing to go back next time I visit Kyoto! It is a working religious facility so you cannot take pictures of the beautiful painted pillars, gold decorations, and dragon-like stairs. The staff is very friendly and kind. Make sure to visit the Pagoda with a view of Kyoto! They have bike parking, lockers, and red stamps which you will easily find!

Nero Insahn,2018-04-02 15:37:51,5,1,"Lovely place. We visited this temple for the Autumn night illumination. The price is ¥600 per person. If you took the subway, it'll take about 20 minutes walk. The path towards the temple is very dark at night so just follow the crowd. Leave your tripods at the hotel as you won't be allowed to use it in the temple vicinity.

Jo H,2018-07-01 10:26:54,5,0,"I dare say this is the best temple complex in Kyoto. Entrance fee is 600¥, but it is extremely worth the price. If you happen to be in the Higashiyama area and with limited time, go for this temple. It is rather secluded since it is at the foot of the mountain but the Raku Bus 100 gets you there fast.

There are hardly any tourists so you can really take in the beauty of this place. Besides the main halls, there is also a beautiful open garden which I'm sure looks even better in the autumn. The pagoda overlooks the city and offers a peaceful and stunning view on a clear day. There is a hut for shade as well.

The temple is well known for its Mikaeri Amida, also known as the Buddha Looking Back. There is a legend behind the statue so I highly encourage you to check it for yourself. For those interested in getting a little memento there is a mini souvenir shop with postcards, incense, bracelets and charms. It is unlike the other temple shops which feel very commercialised.

Last entry is at 4pm but the temple closes at 5.

joshua m.,2018-07-05 00:04:20,5,2,"I had a legitimate spiritual experience at this temple.  It's active with monks walking through the complex and later on I was able to catch them chanting which created an amazing ambiance.  The people were friendly and I chatted a bit with the lady in the gift shop and if you're one to purchase souvenirs, then this is a good place to do it.  She even gave me a little bonus gift which goes to show the type of goodwill I experienced.  There is a cemetery which was interesting to walk around.  One part of the complex you can walk through some structures with a complementary cup of green tea and this has a small zen-style garden surrounding it.  Make sure not to miss the pagoda at the top of the premises which will give you a fantastic snapshot of Kyoto.  Also, make sure not to miss the main temple with the Buddha who is looking back.  I was really pleased that I put this place on my itinerary.

The temple itself is well-kept and quite large so expect an hour or more of time to spend here. There was a lot of visitors, making walking around quite difficult, but it forces you to relax yourself which is good (especially for someone used to the fast pace of a city life like myself)

Joe Le,2023-05-23 14:08:55,5,0,"This is the most beautiful and breath-taking spot in Kyoto.  As you take your shoes off to enter the temple, you don't realize what awaits you. There is quite a bit of history and story as you walk through the temple. Paintings and scrolls take you back in time and describe the Buddhist history. But it is after you tour the temple that defines the beauty of the city.  You start down a pebbled path and a vibrant scene of koi ponds and red maples.  It will truly take your breath away.  This is a must-do part of your itinerary.

Sander van Vliet,2023-06-03 14:37:25,5,0,"One of my favourite temples I visited in Kyoto! Why? First of all you have to take your shoes off to be able to wander around the temple. But that's not all, cause the boardwalk is huge! I spend at least half an hour walking around on my socks. From area to area with slopes, steps, stairs and nice viewpoints. The complete boardwalk is covered by a roof so perfect for a rainy day as well to shelter from the sun on a hot day. Unfortunately I don't have a lot of pics, cause I made them all with my camera. If you go up by the (photo genetic) rotating stairs you have some nice views. When you finish with your boardwalk, you can take your shoes again and explore the outdoor area.
