From the main gate, it feels like a mix of China, not Japanese style. Historically, it was founded by Ingen Zenji who came from Fujian Province during the Edo period, so I understand the reason for the Chinese style.
All of them are important cultural properties of the country, but the doors are not closed, and the atmosphere is as it is, but the gardens and passages are really beautifully maintained and comfortable.

Â••ÊùëÊÖé‰πüÔºàOK computerÔºâ,2021-04-04 13:12:40,4,14," Manpukuji Temple is the head temple of the Obaku sect in Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture. This is the central temple of the Obaku sect, which was the last to be established among the various sects of Buddhism before the early modern period in Japan. The style of the building and Buddhist statues, the manners of the ceremonies, and the vegetarian cuisine are all Chinese-style, and the scenery is different from that of typical Buddhist temples in Japan.
Founder Ryuji Ingen was born in the 20th year of the Ming dynasty (1592) in Fuzhou Prefecture, Fujian Province. At the age of 29, he entered the Buddhist priesthood, and at the age of 46, he became the chief priest of Manpuku-ji Temple on Mount Obaku in his hometown. Ingen was a famous monk even in the Ming dynasty at that time, and his fame reached Japan.
Ingen was invited to come to Japan in the 11th year of Meireki Junji, 1654, when he was 63 years old. At that time, Japan adopted a policy of isolation and travel with foreign countries was extremely limited. temple) was built. Ingen came to Japan at the invitation of the priest Itsuden Shoto of Kofuku-ji Temple in Nagasaki. At first, the monk Itsuzen invited was a disciple of Ingen, a monk named Yaran Shokei, but the ship Yaran was on was in trouble and he never returned. . Therefore, Izen decided to invite Yaki's teacher, Ingen, who was well known in Japan. At first, Ingen declined to come to Japan because of his advanced age, but he received many invitations from the Japanese side. to decide.
Ingen, who came to Japan with 30 disciples in 1654, lived first at Kofuku-ji Temple in Nagasaki, then at Fumon-ji Temple in Tomita, Settsu Province (now Takatsuki City, Osaka Prefecture). Ingen promised the disciples he left behind for Ming that he would return to Japan in three years. In the third year of his arrival in Japan, he received many letters from Ming's disciples and supporters requesting Ingen's return to Japan. The followers on the Japanese side strongly hoped that Ingen would stay in Japan, and they were also appealing to the Edo bakufu to that effect. In 1658, Ingen went to Edo and had an audience with the fourth shogun Tokugawa Ietsuna. Ietsuna also devoted himself to Ingen, and in the following year, 1660, the shogunate gave him the territory of the Konoe family in Uji, Yamashiro Province, where the Owada palace of Chumonin, the birth mother of Emperor Gomizunoo, was located. , a new temple was to be built for Ingen. At this point, Ingen also decided to stay in Japan, and although he was supposed to return to Japan after staying for three years, he ended up burying his bones in Japan.
The temple was named Obakusan Manpuku-ji Temple, which has the same name as the temple in his hometown of Fuzhou, and was founded in 1661. Almost completed.
Manpuku-ji Temple, the head temple of the Obaku sect, was built in the style of the late Ming dynasty, and the precincts of the temple form a different space from many other temples in Japan. In addition, many of the Buddhist statues were created by Fan Daosheng, a Buddhist sculptor from the Qing dynasty who came to Japan and lived in Nagasaki, and are of a continental style. The language used in the temple and the manners of the ceremonies are also in the style of the Ming Dynasty, so even today the Chinese flavor remains strong. The shojin ryori at this temple is a Chinese-style dish called fucha ryori, which uses a lot of vegetable oil and is characterized by being served on a large plate and eaten separately. Manpuku-ji Temple is also known as a temple related to the founder of Sencha-do, Baisao. Ingen and his disciples Mokuan Seixin and Sokuhi Ryouichi were both masters of calligraphy, and these three were called 'Oubaku no Sanpitsu'. In this way, Ingen's visit to Japan and the founding of Manpuku-ji Temple not only brought new Zen to Japan, but also brought various aspects of Chinese culture to Japan. Ingen is said to have brought in beans, which is named after Ingen, as well as moso bamboo, watermelons, and lotus roots.
The temple faces west and is arranged symmetrically. After passing through the main gate, Hojoike Pond is on the right, and beyond that is the Sanmon Gate. In front of the Sanmon is the Tennoden Hall, behind it is the Daiyuhoden Hall, and further back is the Hojoden Hall, which is lined up in a straight line from west to east. These halls are connected by corridors. Along the square-shaped corridor connecting the Tennoden and the Daiohoden, on the right (south side) are the bell tower, Garan-do Hall, and Sai-do Hall. is built. These buildings differ from general temple architecture in Japan in that they were built in the style of the late Ming Dynasty, using teak wood from the south. The balustrade with the swastika kuzushi design, the arched ceiling called the obaku ceiling, the circular windows, and the decorations carved into the door in the shape of peach seeds called the peach fruit are rarely found in other temples in Japan. Unusual designs and techniques are often used. In addition to these, there is a block called Shoin-do, which is the pagoda of the founding mountain, on the left (north) of the approach between Sanmon and Tenno-den, where Kaizan-do Hall, reliquary hall, etc. are built.
Twenty-three main buildings, cloisters, frames, joints, etc. are designated as national important cultural properties as representative buildings of Zen Buddhism.

It is still a large temple, and although it is from the Edo period, you can see the atmosphere of old China (Ming Dynasty) everywhere. The carved wooden fish left a deep impression on me, but I was surprised to learn that it was the original form of the wooden fish (Kainagi/Kaipan).

Â±±Âè£Ë£ï‰∏Ä,2021-08-02 14:57:11,4,10," From my home in Hirakata City, I had to go through the side road of National Route 1 and Keiji Bypass, and on the way, I had to go through a railroad crossing and a narrow road, but I was able to arrive by moving as instructed by the navigation. However, the parking lot was not dedicated to Manpuku-ji Temple, which was specified by the navigation, but parked in the parking lot in front of the main gate. A few hundred meters before the position specified by the navigation, the parking lot in front of the main gate jumped into my eyes, so I thought for a moment that this was a mistake, but the parking lot space is wide enough and I can park. The fee was the same as the amount I had checked in advance, so I decided to park in the Somonmae parking lot after all. The basic parking fee is 500 yen for the first 90 minutes and 200 yen for every additional 30 minutes. The only difference is the content of the service. If you spend 3,000 yen or more at the cafeteria attached to the parking lot in front of the main gate, you can get a 90-minute free parking ticket. On the other hand, the private parking lot is free for those who can eat Fucha cuisine at Manpuku-ji Temple. I think it takes about 90 minutes just to eat fucha cuisine, so if you can eat fucha cuisine, it is almost certainly better to use the private parking lot. In my case, the purpose of this day was only to visit, so it seems that there was no mistake in choosing the parking lot in front of the main gate, which costs the same as the private parking lot. By the way, the time required for the visit on this day was about 2 hours, exceeding 90 minutes.
The admission fee is 500 yen.
Many of the buildings were made in the Chinese style, and I was able to enjoy the space of a different culture. In addition, the faces of the Buddha statues are richly expressive and have distinct features, and among them, the Rakan statues are so wonderful that each one has a unique expression, gesture, and appearance that seems to speak to me.

A 5-minute walk from JR and Keihan Obaku Station. Recently, it seems that China is not very popular with Japanese people, but Ganjin at Toshodaiji Temple and Ingen at Manpukuji Temple are different.

Manpuku-ji Temple was opened in 1661 during the Edo period by a splendid master named Ingen. Mr. Ingen, who used to be a chief priest in Fujian Province, was invited to Japan with a promise of three years, but in the end, he won't be able to go back.
During that time, a lot of culture and customs have been left behind. Letters too... That's right!

Another sculptor, Fan Daosheng, left many Buddha statues at Manpuku-ji Temple. Knowing about the lives of these two men, I understand well that Japanese monks trusted and eventually respected them.

It's quite wide, so if you pass through the Sanmon gate, you can see the Tennoden in front of you. Hotei-sama (a seated statue of Miroku Bosatsu) is enshrined here, and the guardian deity of the temple is surrounded by a standing statue of Idaten and the Four Heavenly Kings.

Further to the back, Daiyuhoden, the principal image of Buddha, where the statue of Shakyamuni is enshrined, along with his disciples Anan and Kasha. And there are 18 Arhat statues, and the Rakanra Sonja in the middle on the right has a Buddha in the chest door... It is said to be made by Fan Daosheng. It's rare, so it's a must-see ‚ú®

According to the temple legend, in 1661, a Chinese monk named ""Ingen Ry≈´ki"" founded the temple in Uji with about 20 disciples, and in 1870, founded a sect of the Obaku sect!
The Obaku sect is one of the Zen sects and seems to value Chinese style. In the early days of Manpuku-ji Temple, monks from China performed rituals such as morning and evening rituals, and the tradition of Obaku sect such as chanting sutras has been handed down to the present day. The buildings in the precincts also have a Chinese-style atmosphere, and when you see a dragon in the precincts of the temple, it is said that the diamond-shaped stone on the approach path represents the back of the dragon, and it is said that you should not step on the stone (after visiting the shrine). I found out) On the left and right in front of the main gate, there was a Ryume well, which is the eye of the dragon.
The kaipan hanging in front of the Saido (dining hall) in the precinct corridor is still used today to inform the monks of their meal times!

The Obaku sect, which is also used as the name of places and stations around here, is a major feature that conveys the style of the Ming Dynasty in China as it is. For this reason, both the structure of the temple and the appearance of the Buddha have a Chinese style that is a bit different from other Buddhist temples.
For example, Miroku Bodhisattva enshrined in the front Tennoden. It is a grateful Buddha who saves all living beings after Shakyamuni's death, but at this temple, the Hotei-sama Buddha of the Seven Lucky Gods greets worshipers with a hearty smile.
In addition, the Buddha of the largest hall, Daiohoden, is Shakyamuni Buddha (Shaka Nyorai) in the center, but on both sides is not Kannon, but the venerable Buddha (Kasha, Anan), and on both sides are the 18 Arhats. As I said, the atmosphere is quite different from Japanese Buddhist temples.
In addition, there are various novelties such as a giant wooden fish called kaipan (actually shaped like a fish) that attracts my interest. As one of the few temples in Kyoto where you can feel the atmosphere of a foreign country, I think it is a valuable presence.

Obakusan Manpukuji is a temple of the Obaku sect of Zen Buddhism founded in 1661 by Ingen Ryuki. The sect was originally called the Obaku sect of the Rinzai sect, but in 1876, it became independent and officially called the Obaku sect.

Zen master was a high priest who represented the Rinzai sect of the Ming Dynasty in China, and was the chief priest of Manpukuji Temple on Mt. In 1654, at the age of 63, he came to Japan with 20 disciples and others in response to repeated invitations from Japan. Since then, a Chinese monk has served as the chief priest until the thirteenth generation.

Perhaps because of that influence, it is a Chinese Ming Dynasty style temple that retains a Chinese atmosphere. For example, the paving stones in the precincts are arranged in a diamond shape, which is said to represent the scales on the back of a dragon. The main hall is made of teak, which is native to Southeast Asia.

Anyway, the atmosphere is completely different from Japanese temples, so I definitely want you to go and experience it for yourself.
