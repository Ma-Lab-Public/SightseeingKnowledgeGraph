Radhiyatam Mardhiyah,2016-11-13 02:25:44,5,2,"Beautiful temple! We went there on a weekday around 10am, although the place was a little bit crowded, the atmosphere was still nice and peaceful. On the rock garden which is viewed from the veranda of the Abbot's Residence, you can see the white sand that covers the garden (25 meters in width and 10 meters deep), with 15 rocks scattered in five locations in a simple yet beautiful design. It is said that no matter your location on the veranda, you cannot see all of the rocks!

One can sit there for hours and enjoy the scenery. Outside, the gardens in autumn are amazing with a rainbow of colors to enjoy. The more time I spend here, the more I love it.

Abhishek Ghosh,2017-12-16 16:38:31,5,0,"I would say this is not for everyone. Highly recommended if you enjoy nature and peace. The zen Buddhist has created an orthogonal design of nature which appears more marvelous the longer you look at it. I would recommend to sit down at the stone garden and pondering over the structures. Again, not for everyone!

Marc-Olivier Lelièvre,2018-04-14 17:20:53,4,0,"I visited the temple and gardens on a Wednesday around midday, and was pleasantly surprised to see how few tourists there were (I'm not sure if it was because it was windy/cloudy with chances of rain). The temple's location isn't directly on a JR line or subway line, but it was not too difficult to find. Take the JR to Uzumasa station, walk a few hundred metres to the Satsueisho-mae trolley station, and take the trolley headed towards Ryoanji. There were clear directions provided in English from Uzumasa station, and once at Satsueisho-mae, there are also clear directives in English (including fare structure and which direction you need to head in depending on where you need to go). Get off the trolley at Ryoanji station and walk through the streets until you reach the temple area. I was so impressed to see clear signs in English marking the way through the streets towards the temple. The area seems to be very tourist friendly.
The temple itself costs 500 yen, and includes access to the temple and UNESCO rock garden, as well as other gardens on the property and the trail leading around the pond. The rock garden is quite bare and simplistic, so don't go expecting anything too crazy. Also, although there were not too many tourists, there were still enough to take away from the ""zen"" feel of the garden. You will not be able to sit peacefully and meditate unless you come early and before the masses.
There was a beautiful garden after the temple/rock garden but not much else. If you're not that into temples and gardens, it may not be the most exciting spot to visit.

It was Cherry blossoms season so there were plenty of Sakura offering beautiful scenes and I enjoyed taking lots of photographs. The ambience within the temple was very calm, and it is a good place to walk around and relax.
The most significant part of this temple is the Rock Garden. There is a garden inside the temple with 15 rocks of various shapes and sizes without any plants. It has got some religious importance. I have seen such kind of garden for the first time and it was a wonderful experience for me. If you all have never seen Rock Garden like me before, then do visit here to see it.

Robin “sumghai” Chang,2019-05-12 22:38:27,5,0,"Located in the northwest if the city, this Zen Buddhist temple and UNESCO World Heritage Site is famed for its dry landscape garden, consisting of fifteen distinctive rock formations arranged within a sea of smooth pebbles raked into linear meditative patterns.

Only fourteen of the fifteen rocks are visible from any given angle, and it has been said that only through attaining enlightenment would one be able to see the fifteenth boulder.

In addition to admiring the tranquility of the gardens, ponds and cherry blossoms in bloom, I also enjoyed a lunch of boiled tofu and vegetables served at the Ryoan-ji Yidofu restaurant within the temple grounds.

Yet another must-visit tourist spot!

TIP: Like most temples in Kyoto, be sure to visit this early in the morning to beat the rush of local and international tourists.

"Dr. Michael Kohlberger, BSc MSc",2019-10-23 04:39:25,3,2,"This must be my temple #200 in Kyoto. I thought since it's a bit away from the center, it will be more tranquil and maybe (maybe!) I won't have to pay an entrance fee.

Well, I'm writing this review while sitting on the toilet in front of the temple and shopping underwear on Amazon. It's just 500¥, but that's 500¥ too much.

Edit: Didn't find underwear and decided to go in anyway. The rock garden totally blows (as expected) but the trees are kinda cool. Still not recommended except if you really haven't seen any Japanese gardens yet. The one next to Himeji castle is the best one I've seen so far.

Glee Glee,2022-11-17 15:47:06,5,7,"This is my favorite place in Kyoto.  My first visit was when I lived here in the 90's and I try to go whenever I make it back. The grounds are beautiful and peaceful.  You can walk around and enjoy the sense of ancient history or go directly to the temple and gaze on the peaceful rock garden.  I love the huge wooden beams and paintings on the sliding doors.  I try to imagine what it must have been like to live in a place like this in ancient times.

My father has some mobility issues and we were able to take a taxi and get close enough for him to walk in at a sedate pace.  Be prepared to take your shoes off at the entrance.

The shop sells the typical omamori charms for good health and so forth.  They also sell incense and wall art and those books that you can take to temples for stamps.  I have a wall print of one of the large rocks from the garden as well as some incense to burn in memory of my mother.

Gajaraj Maharjan,2023-04-29 07:40:56,4,0,"Not the ""happy place"" but the ""zen place"" what lacks in number of attraction is filled in by nature. It's a wooden building, rock and moss and nature engulfing everything.

Justin Hudgins,2023-05-09 04:41:35,5,0,"I love this temple. The whole atmosphere is so peaceful and pleasant. The gift shop is one of the best I’ve seen in a temple, offering all kinds of things, from goshuin books and bags to incense, art, and a cute paperweight. It’s quite close to Kinkaku-ji, so if you go there I’d strongly recommend coming here as well.

It's my favorite Spot in Kyoto and I highly recommend to Stop by. If you do, pleased enjoy the place in a calm or silent way. Other visiters will be thankful.",no,,view review

Max Pietsch (Max),2023-05-14 12:57:28,5,0,"The rock garden here was fascinating. It showed how you can make something beautiful without much.

There are some trees on the grounds, too, which are cut in a beautiful way, and a large stone pagoda. Worth checking them out, too.

We got here at 9am, an hour after it opened, and it was busy.",no,,view review
James Milner,2023-05-18 03:40:37,2,0,"We felt it really wasn't worth the visit. The rock garden is not at all impressive - there are far more interesting places in Kyoto to see. The walk around the lake is nice but again very low maintenance and not memorable at all.

la noix de grenoble,2023-05-18 10:41:32,3,0,"Do it if you go to Kinkaku-ji because it's not far from there, but I don't necessarily recommend when there are not flowers, the zen garden is nice but the whole site itself is small and there are better temples in Kyoto",no,,view review
Daniel Hoffmann,2023-05-27 01:40:42,5,1,"Wonderful zen garden. It is quiet and no one should speak out loud. in the middle is a lake with a small island. There is a shrine on it.

Leo H.,2023-05-28 13:56:35,5,1,"I underestimated the size of Ryoan-ji, thinking it was just the rock garden. A large portion of the temple grounds is a lake. It hosts a variety of flora all around it and it's all lined with moss. The trees tower over the pathway and you can take a relaxing stroll around the lake for a more romantic vibe.

The main attraction, the rock garden, is stunning. There is something captivating about these rocks suspended along grains of white rocks. All other visitors were quiet, as if we were all entranced by the view.

Highly recommend going in the winter so you don't contend the space with many tourists, and you can get front row seats to view the garden

Kingston Obike,2023-06-06 09:25:16,3,1,"It’s a typical serene and nature-filled environment as with most gardens and temples in Kyoto, what sets this one apart would probably be the stone garden. At a glimpse it may just look like well placed rocks and nothing more, but the significance of such gardens is in how well they prepare your mind for meditation, a blank mind is the way and I find that staring into that open space for a while actually helps in that regard. It’s a great place to clear your mind when you find yourself perplexed with thought.
