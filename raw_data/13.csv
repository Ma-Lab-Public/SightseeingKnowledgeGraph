(This is Obviously due to covid times) it Feels so special and we enjoyed our morning here thoroughly taking photos and catching the gorgeous tall bamboo in different lights ‚òÄÔ∏è

I remember visiting here a few years ago and it feels like a different place as it‚Äôs so empty just now. Best of all it‚Äôs free and you can come back anytime :)

Although the actual garden is a single path, it is absolutely worth the trip. Definitely check out the breathtaking views by the Katsura River nearby as well as the cute street leading to it. Plenty of eateries to explore.

But fortunately the rest of Arashiyama nearby has nice views of a valley that opens into a wider and cool river. It also has some less frequent grounds and trails for a walk. 4 stars if you take them together in the same trip.

Ali Abbasi,2022-11-15 05:58:16,5,17,"An obvious must visit when in Kyoto. For photographers, get there before sunrise. The bamboo forest path itself won‚Äôt really benefit but if you go through it, take a left at the end, cross the hill you can get down to this lovely waterfront along the river. Really lovely mist and light in the early morning with few locals out for their walks.
Once the sun is out you can head back to the bamboo path which by now will be full of people but lit up.
The pro-tip is checking out the temple grounds on the way back to town, which apparently has its own secret bamboo path that should be relatively empty! I learned about this too late but maybe you‚Äôll have better luck.
Overall a lovely experience.

Pawan Maharjan (Pawn mrzn),2022-12-06 11:57:18,5,2,"Located at the foot of the ‚ÄúStorm Mountains‚Äù in the north of the city of Kyoto, this world-famous, seemingly endless forest of swaying bamboo boughs is perfect for a relaxing retreat to nature during a stay in Japan.

The Arashiyama bamboo grove is open 24/7 and admission is free. The surrounding Arashiyama district, known for unique fishing methods which involve using trained cormorant birds, is also well worth a visit.

Its main street and Togetsu-kyo Bridge have been called a ‚Äútourist circus,‚Äù but beyond this thoroughfare, Arashiyama offers an authentic and unforgettable Japanese experience. Read on to discover how the bamboo forest is just the beginning.

This sightseeing district makes for an incredible day trip from Kyoto. From lush forests to cherry blossoms to vibrant autumn koyo colors, Arashiyama is a visual delight.

Arashiyama‚Äôs Sagano Bamboo Forest, or Bamboo Grove, is both locally famous and world-renowned. Visitors can stroll paths lined with endless rows of towering bamboo. The experience has been described as other-worldly, serene, and dreamlike.

The sound of the rustling bamboo within this forest has been named one of the ‚Äú100 Soundscapes of Japan‚Äù by the Japanese Ministry of Environment. Together with Fushimi Inari and the Kinkaku-ji, it offers a Kyoto experience not to be missed.

The bamboo grove is open 24 hours a day and boasts no admission fee, so it is recommended that during peark season, you visit it early in the morning or at sunset.

From Kyoto Station, take the JR San-in or Sagano lines (included in your JR Pass) to Saga-Arashiyama Station. The train ride lasts approximately 20 minutes. Stops include:

Umekoji-Kyotonishi Station
Tambaguchi Station
Nijo Station (near Nijo Castle)
Emmachi Station (connection to the 102 bus to Kinkaku-ji)
Hanazono Station
From the JR Saga-Arashiyama Station, you may take a bus, which departs approximately every seven minutes. Alternatively, you may walk about 15 minutes to the bamboo grove. Keep in mind that trains departing from the Hankyu Arashiyama Station are not covered by the JR Pass.

Next to the station is the red-brick building of Saga Torokko Station, from where you can take the Sagano Scenic Railway, also included in your JR Pass. This romantic train passes a gorge offering a lovely view along the Hozu River.

Signs for the Tenryuji Temple will greet you as soon as you exit Arashiyama Station. This World Heritage Site has an entrance fee of ¬•500 (less than $5.00 US) and offers spectacular autumn colors. The Zen temple grounds house the entrance to the bamboo grove, a symbol of strength thought to ward off evil.

Other temples in the area include the Tendai sect Buddhist Nison-in Temple, the Jojako-ji Temple, the thatch-roofed Gio-ji Temple, and the many-statued Adashino-Nembutsu-ji Temple.

Finally, you can also visit the Okochi Sanso Villa, home of the late silent movie actor Denjiro Okochi. The villa and gardens cover almost 20.000 square meters, including espectacular gardens and magnificent views of Kyoto city and the Hozu river.

A trip to Arashiyama is like taking an excursion to another world ‚Äì a simpler, more peaceful time. If you‚Äôre ready to relax and recharge, book your JR Pass and start planning your next Japan vacation today.

It's possible to get shots if we all take turns. There was only or two foreigner couples that would go cut everyone and get in everyone's shot making it more difficult to work with.

When in the Grove take a minute to look straight up and see the bamboo as it reaches towards the sky. It is stunningly beautiful on a sunny day.

K Yeo,2023-05-06 09:30:19,5,2,"We took the trains from Osaka to Arashiyama station and started our walk from around 10+am. It was a bit late and there were already many people here on a weekend.

There were two sections of Bamboo Forest and the earlier section has smaller trees, so make sure you do not spend too much time there. The bamboo trees were extremely tall and the stems were thick and dark. Really different and may be really old. They were so tall that taking photos with the tops were really challenging. Hahah!

There were also a lot of people and you really have to wait for the right opportunity to quickly take your shots. Of course, there are also nice people who will give you some time but not much, so hurry. There is something peaceful about being in a bamboo forest. Try to find an area near the end of the forest to enjoy the rustling leaves and sun's rays shining through. There are also other smaller ones in the temples nearby that has good ambience.

We found the grove to be peaceful, larger than we were expecting, and wonderfully photogenic. We loved exploring this quiet area of Kyoto. Highly recommended.

Boogie Setiawan,2023-05-08 00:44:01,5,1,"A serene place during non peak season. When you visit Arashiyama, make sure you spare enough time to explore the surrounding as it has a couple of very beautiful places and shrines.

You could also spend time chilling by the river or renting wooden boat. A lot of cute cafes as well around the spot.

Even at 7 am, there's already people haha, so coming very early is recommended, especially during Golden Week :)

Azzu Amri,2023-05-08 14:46:39,5,0,"A serene walk along the bamboo grooves. The place spells 'tranquillity'. During my daytrip visit (around 4.00 pm), the weather is not so sunny and a bit windy. The bamboo swayed in the wind and emits a pleasant whistling sound. There was quite a crowd since it was public holiday but the walk is a long stretch, I managed to snap some photos of my kids minus the people. Love it here though I stayed not for long to catch the train back to Osaka.

I‚Äôd recommend going early because this is a very touristy place and it was extremely crowded when we went. I recommend coming here and then going to the monkey park after as they are very close to each other! Prepare for a long day of walking though

Jasmin Haugstuen P,2023-05-15 06:28:57,4,1,"It was great ! VERY packed on a Monday at 9am already. It was beautiful but not one of my favorite places in Kyoto. If you have to choose I wouldn‚Äôt choose this over the golden pavilion or the Fushimi Inari for example that has some bamboo in the trail and makes for better photos. If you show up earlier then this though you should get a peaceful walk, and it IS definitely worth it even with the crowds. We paid to go to the famous king fu actors (name escapes me üòÖ) house and gardens which included GREAT matcha and a nice less crowded walk, it was nice.

Arashiyama Bamboo Grove was really packed with tourists and Japanese students on field trips. Before arriving to the place, there are plenty of souvenir shops at good prices! Must visit.
There were also food shops leading to the place.
Sad to say there were vandals who damaged some of the bamboos, I hope we don‚Äôt leave permanent marks to this beautiful place in Arashiyama.

Harrison Linck,2023-05-18 13:46:30,3,0,"Way smaller than expected. Hard to justify the trip just for the bamboo, though Arashiyama itself was beautiful.

If you're in the area, highly recommend visiting Kinkaku-ji (the golden pavilion)

David H,2023-05-18 19:58:01,4,0,"I've never seen a bamboo forest before, so this was pretty cool to me despite many saying it's overrated. I will say though that the insane crowd of people did take away from the scenery for sure, and I couldn't really get any of the pictures I wanted. So, I would recommend trying to come early in the morning if you want to avoid that.

The Gal Travels,2023-05-20 23:31:38,4,0,"Be prepared to walk. The entrance of the forest is usually very crowded then once you clear that you begin a steep incline for about 10 minutes before it flattens out. It‚Äôs not a big area and is very dark because of the tall bamboo trees. After that, as you head toward the river you will pass by a lovely garden. Personally, I prefer the river bank, the garden and the shopping area around it than the bamboo forest itself.

Apart from the area around the river bank, the area inside the forest and garden is not mobile accessible friendly. My suggestion if you are on a wheelchair or have issues with steep slopes and stairs, just spend the area around the river bank and enjoy a meal rather than struggle through the forest.

Just walking through the corridor under the long and slim trees is wonderful. If you are lucky, you will see also some of the local girls wearing the traditional kimono. Then the scenery is even more catchy. Thank you ü§©

Timmy Lingg,2023-05-22 08:25:49,3,1,"It is a very lovely place to visit but it is on the smaller side and therefore the amount of visitors is too much. Additionally some walkways through the forest were closed.

We were visited the place on a Monday morning at around 8.30 a.m. ish and is was already packed. Taking some pictures here and there was a challenge. You might get lucky on a Wednesday.

The coffee shops do not open before 11 a.m. in the near vicinity of the bamboo forest. But there the all known vending machines.
For a fresh coffee you will have to walk to the town next to the monkey park.

Leslie Lee,2023-05-23 03:29:12,5,1,"Walking through the bamboo forest on a cool and tranquil Sunday afternoon in May was an incredibly pleasant experience. The serene ambiance and the gentle breeze added to the charm of the surroundings. The towering bamboo stalks created a mesmerizing atmosphere, providing a sense of peace and serenity as I strolled along the forest path. It was a wonderful way to unwind and connect with nature, making it a truly memorable part of my day.

Alia Shapiro,2023-05-27 13:41:49,5,1,"The weather was hot, so the grove was much cooler due to the bamboo shoots sheltering from the sun. The view is amazing. As you walk onwards, there is a slight gradient upwards leading to different routes, even to temples. As it was past 430pm, most of the temples were closed so do take note to go there much earlier in the afternoon.

Joe C,2023-05-27 14:23:50,4,0,"Most my pictures are angled up because there were so many people there when we visited in early March. It was definitely hard to snap a picture.

But if you are visiting Monkey Park this is such a close activity to do right after that I'd definitely recommend it. (30min-1hr  hike/walk)

If you keep traveling thru Bamboo Grove onto the connected Kameyama Park and go south towards Katsura River that is where it is absolutely stunning.

I can imagine when cherry blossoms are in full bloom this place would be packed.

You will be constantly surrounded by people taking photos and videos. That being said, it's still a great sight to see. I really enjoyed it and I liked seeing the bamboo. I also got some cool pictures myself. Definitely worth a visit if you want some pictures, but not a peaceful or calm walk.

Because this is an EXTREMELY popular tourist destination, it is overrun by tourists. All trying to take a selfie, while 1000's of people surround you, also all trying to take a selfie.

We got there around 0730 on a Saturday and there was already a small crowd there, but just small enough to still enjoy a little calm quietness and get nice pictures (despite a couple of influencers taking very elaborate selfies). By 8am, it was starting to feel pretty crowded.
If you want to guarantee no crowds I‚Äôm guessing you need be there before 0700.
Also the bamboo grove is relatively small compared to the way it usually seems in pictures.
