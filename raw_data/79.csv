Lai,2017-11-12 15:37:50,5,2,"Picturesque tranquillity in a historical setting. The temple has been rebuilt following several fires and people have died to build this temple as they had to bring down wood from mountainous regions of Japan. This gives you an extra layer of appreciation to the quiet awe you experience once you enter the premises. It's free as they say and it was very quiet even on a Sunday afternoon. You need to put your shoes in a plastic bag before going into any of the buildings. This keeps everything clean and no pictures inside as it's a space of worship. There is also a small gallery with pictures.

Although the area open for visit (as of 2020) are quite small, and you could probably cover the whole place in under 20 minutes, it has quite a charm to it.
