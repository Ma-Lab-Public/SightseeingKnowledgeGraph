In recent years, the figure skating figure skater Hanyu Yuzuru has used the song SEIMEI, and it seems that it has become a place related to Hanyu's fans.

It is a shrine that wards off evil, and there is a yakuyoke peach in the precincts. Peach is said to be a fruit that wards off evil. It is said that by rubbing the peach against the misfortune that you have in yourself, you will be able to ward off misfortune.
It's a small shrine, but it became popular after a novel that was made into a manga and a movie became a hit, and it seems that many young people especially visit the shrine.
My hobby is taking pictures of flowers (I live in Osaka Prefecture).
On this day (July 13, 2022), I visited to take pictures of bellflowers.
Seimei Shrine's crest is a five-pointed star, which is said to ward off evil spirits. It is said that it is also called ""Seimei Kikyo"", which is a design of the flower of the bellflower.
From the origin of such a company crest, it seems that bellflowers are planted in the precincts. I think it's a perfect shrine for the noble and beautiful image of the bellflower.
In addition, there was an omikuji (fortune slip) for this time (corona wreck), so I will introduce it (photo attached). It is a non-contact omikuji, and when you wave your hand toward the sensor, the Shikigami tells you the number from the screen (computer).

KOJI,2022-08-20 03:14:30,5,25," When I first visited the shrine, I thought it was a small but nasty shrine because of the store-like goods sales area in front of the shrine and the autographs of celebrities.

This is a special place among the many shrines in Kyoto.
Thanks to visiting various shrines as a hobby, I have acquired the ability to feel the atmosphere of a place.
The same atmosphere as here is when I went to Sumiyoshi Taisha, but the kind of power is a little different? It is a feeling that cannot be expressed in words.
I don't think he's stronger than Konpira Yasui, but his power is too strong and I can't calm down. Of course, Mr. Yasui is a wonderful shrine.

This is my personal impression, but Kyoto people are generally famous for avoiding misfortune here, and Jonangu is here for warding off evil.

I'm sorry that I'm not the type to go to shrines to seek blessings, but this is a good shrine to seek blessings, and it's probably beneficial.
Is the adoration of the people making a place? I don't know if it's Seimei's power, but it's a really special place.

This is the only amulet I wear (excluding the ujigami), and I always get the directional cards from here.
Of course, I always feel your benefit.

Depending on the person, it may look like a shrine for business purposes, but I think it's worth a visit.

Well, there are shrines and temples everywhere in Kyoto.

As soon as you pass through the torii (first torii) from the main street, you will pass through another torii (four shrine gates) to reach the precincts. In the precincts, you can see the statue of Abe no Seimei, a sacred tree, and peaches that ward off evil. The texture didn't look that different from the shrines I usually see, but I often saw the shape of a star (five-pointed star).

I imagined that the building would have many mythological elements, but it is set up as a normal shrine. There was also a souvenir shop, and we were dealing with a lot of things with five-pointed stars. I suggested something to my companion as a memorial, but it was answered immediately.

It was a wonderful space.
Prince Abe no Seimei also visited
You can also touch the sacred tree
The weather was good, and the autumn leaves were still beautiful, and it was the best.
The lady at the souvenir shop was also very kind to us.
I will definitely visit again to touch that atmosphere.

Takuma („Éë„Éë„Éä„ÉÉ„ÉÑ),2023-01-05 07:31:01,4,2," Visited in 2014.
A shrine that enshrines Abe no Seimei, who is loved by Japanese people even 1000 years after his death. If you like the occult, Onmyoji, and power spots, this historic site is a must-visit.
The votive plaques of celebrities that are displayed in the precincts are interesting because they show the individuality of the celebrities who donated so much that it is hard to tell whether they are a wish or a work of art. I wonder how many times Baku Yumemakura, who took the world by storm with his novel Onmyoji, has visited.

‰ΩêËó§ÂçÉÂØøÂ≠ê,2023-01-06 05:25:29,5,0," Founded in 1007. Abe no Seimei, an astronomer from the middle of the Heian period, is enshrined at Seimei Shrine, which stands on the site of his own residence. The shrine building has a subdued color tone and does not feel flashy at all. The impression is that the scale is not large and it is a quiet shrine.
However, the five-pointed star (the so-called star mark) is simple and eye-catching.

I came early in the morning at a small shrine, but the parking lot was waiting for my turn. It is a place where we are waiting for you to visit and pray. It seems that the weather will be fine and I will be able to go home with a refreshing feeling.

It is located a little south of Imadegawa on Horikawa-dori, which runs north-south in Kyoto, and it seems that it is included in the sightseeing tour plan.
Since I was taken care of by the exorcism, I visit every year to pay my respects.

Áî∞‰∏≠Roon,2023-02-13 03:05:25,5,0," Abe no Seimei, a famous Onmyoji, is a shrine famous for its enshrined deity. It seems that many celebrities are visiting. The scale of the precincts is not large, but it is a shrine where you can feel the aura. For those visiting by car, the nearby Furano Park 77.1 is convenient.

While thinking about where to go next
At the shrine where the Onmyoji Abe no Seimei is enshrined
I thought I had never been there.

Although it is far from Kyoto Station,
Calm atmosphere with little hustle and bustle
At the shrine, more than I imagined
It was small.

It was an early morning visit, so relax
I spent time alone
I'm glad.

ÈªÉÈÉÅÊ£ª,2023-03-17 15:22:01,3,2," Take a look at Abe Seimei by the way. Although the shrine is small, it is more popular than expected. You can see the signatures (and painted horses) of many actors who play Onmyoji-related works or simply pray for their works to become popular.

The ""five-pointed star that seals the evil"" is drawn everywhere in the precincts. It is interesting that the peach is connected to the Kojiki that it is a fruit that wards off evil ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Dils Chang (Âè∏),2023-04-08 08:16:40,5,4," The legend of the shrine is the reason to attract people. Fans who like onmyoji or spells to control demons must come.
Many of the designs in it are related to Master Jingming's life story.
Affected by the epidemic, the well water of Pentagram is currently closed, but I heard that this water is good for health. The master of the tea ceremony also used this well water for the last tea in his life.

The original site of Liqiao is quite special, it is the first bridge encountered when walking south, pilgrimage fans still have to collect it, but tourists who generally like it still have time to visit, but it doesn‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt have it (it‚Äôs just a small scenic spot ) (my photo is attached)

Three hundred years, peaches and the toes of the statue must be touched. It is said that it can bring luck to drive away bad luck and invigorate Qi.

All the guards, scenes, and torii in it have pentagram symbols, which are quite special shrines.
You can find more relevant information on the Internet. I highly recommend this small attraction. It can be more interesting when combined with interesting fairy tales.

„ÅÇ„Å®„Çä,2023-04-11 09:02:21,4,0," Visited on 16th March 23rd.

It was built on the site of the mansion of Abe no Seimei, an onmyoji in the Heian period.
The enshrined deity is Abe no Seimei, and it is very popular as one of Kyoto's leading power spots.
The ""five-pointed star (star-shaped)"" is a charm that is used to ward off evil, and can be seen here and there in the precincts.

A five-pointed star was projected from the Shishinmon gate next to the second torii.
Because it is reflected by sunlight, it is not reflected when it is raining or cloudy. Also, it seems that the viewing time is limited.

There are splendid camphor trees, which are sacred trees, and peaches that ward off evil, and many people visited to receive power.
I felt like I was given power not only from Seimei Shrine, but also from such bright and positive people.

Seimei Shrine came for the first time in many years.
Seimei Shrine came out when I searched for shrines that were compatible with me on the Internet, so I visited after a long time.

After all, it is not famous compared to Kinkakuji, but there were only Japanese people, not foreigners!
Is it because most Japanese people have heard of ""Abe no Seimei"" or ""Onmyoji"" at least once?

There were two types of omikuji.
Gogyo mikuji is 300 yen
Seimei fortune is 200 yen
The Seimei fortune slip is a non-inoculated lottery, and when you put your hand on the sensor and wave your hand, a number will appear on the screen! !

Goshuin is cute!

It's a small shrine, but it's quiet only in this space and it was comfortable to visit. I touched the peach to ward off evil and touched the sacred tree to receive power. Suzu Mamori was the first one when I was looking for an amulet at the conferment office, so I bought it. When I bought it, I didn't notice it and when I got home and took it out of the bag, the sound of the bell was cool and good, unlike the normal bell sound. I carry it with me on my bag to bring good luck. When you buy an amulet, please listen to the sound of the bell.

The shrine building is small and there is not much to see, but you may be able to feel Abe no Seimei. The time I visited was around 3:00 at the end of May, but it wasn't a good time to take a picture because it was backlit as we headed towards the shrine.
