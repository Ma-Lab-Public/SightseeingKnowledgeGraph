star orion,2022-06-12 03:04:45,5,10," It is a temple that has a lot of important cultural properties on the site which is very large from the outside.
I stopped by when I was in Kyoto, so I didn't have much time, so I was able to see only one. There weren't many tourists in the dry landscape rock garden with a very solemn atmosphere, so I was satisfied with sitting on the veranda and quietly looking at the garden.
The Japanese-style room next to it is decorated with Japan's oldest matchlock gun and a go board where Hideyoshi and Ieyasu played a game, giving you a romantic feel.
The bustling Kyoto sights are nice, but this place was quiet and relaxing.
The temple grounds are all historic buildings, so you'll want to take your time and come back again.

k wataru,2022-06-22 04:37:23,5,14," Daitokuji, a temple associated with Rikyu, is located in Kita Ward, north of Kyoto City. Ryugen-in is especially famous for its dry landscape garden. At the same time, the garden has beautiful moss and a beautiful contrast between green and gray. Speaking of dry landscape gardens, Ryoan-ji Temple is popular worldwide, but this garden is also worth seeing. Zuiho-in's Karesansui (dry landscape garden) is also attractive because of the strict expression of the stones and pebbles.

たけほがら,2022-10-10 06:32:39,4,5," Daitokuji is a large temple located in Murasakino, Kyoto, and is the head temple of the Daitokuji sect of the Rinzai sect. It was founded in 1334 by Zen monk Myocho Shuho under the protection of Emperor Godaigo.

You can freely enter the precincts from either the main gate or the south gate. In the center of the precincts, there is an area where the imperial envoy gate, temple gate, Buddhist hall, and dharma hall are lined up in a straight line.

I wanted to see the National Treasure Karamon, but I couldn't see it because it was in the back of the restricted area.

Sanmon is a two-storied gate and is called Kinmokaku. In 1529, only the lower level was completed with a donation from Renga poet Munenaga, and in 1589, when Sen no Rikyu completed the upper level, it was named 'Kinmokaku.'

Sojun Ikkyu, the model of Ikkyu who is familiar with Tonchi, trained at this temple and became famous as one of the leading high priests in the Muromachi period.

Daitokuji Temple has a deep connection with the world of tea ceremony, and many tea masters, including Sen no Rikyu, seem to have been associated with Daitokuji.

Daitokuji is a cloister of temples rather than a single temple and be aware that each temple has different opening days & times, features, and entrance fees.

I didn't do a lot of research this time, so I ran out of time. There are really many places to see. I feel sorry for myself who only knew about the temple associated with Sen no Rikyu and Ikkyu.
