Patrik Jurčišin,2017-04-29 05:31:12,5,0,"Entrance fee apply Adults ¥600, High School Students ¥400.

To be honest after you pay to get in, you walk around temple and you also can visit museum which is pretty nice. But there is additional fee if you want to go inside the temple ! There is every 15 min tour. I am not sure if you can take pictures inside probably not.

It is a nice peaceful walk through Byodoin Temple with views of some historic arts. Worth a visit if you are in the area. Uji is known for its green tea

Ali Low,2017-11-05 13:20:05,5,2,"A stunning temple a short train journey south of Kyoto.  The symmetric main building is featured on the 10 yen coin.  The entrance fee includes access to the museum which houses some really stunning Buddhist artefacts and is well worth seeing.  For a separate fee you can visit the inside of the main building as part of an about 15 minute tour (in Japanese only).  You purchase a ticket for a timed entry and when I visited we had to wait about 50 minutes before our time.  Probably it's not really worth paying to see the inside.
If possible I'd recommend visiting in the morning when the sun will be behind you when photographing the main building as the lighting was challenging when I visited in the afternoon.

It's a bit far out from Kyoto, but there's a train, which makes it less inconvenient.  If you're planning to visit Kyoto, I recommend that you make a visit to Byodoin.

Best is buy the Phoenix Hall ticket as soon as you arrive and the take the time to visit the ground and the museum which is nicely done. The museum is actually built on modern style and into the slope so make the ground floor museum feels like it is subterranean.

There is a small museum on site, that is of some interest.  Toilets are also to be found, which is always handy.

The temple itself is very attractive.  You are able to enter into the hall as part of a guided group.  Wear nice socks, because you'll be required to take your shoes off if venturing inside.

William T,2019-06-10 12:37:29,5,0,"Byodoin is a beautiful Buddhist temple in Uji, Kyoto. The main hall is nearly 1000 years old and is a designated Japanese natural treasure and World Heritage Site. You might have seen the iconic building before, as it appears on the 10 yen coin. A Phoenix statue from the temple also appears on the back of the 10,000 yen bill.

It is understandably a sacred place for Japan and is definitely worth visiting, despite being a bit on the outskirts of Kyoto. Also check out the numerous treasures from the temple in the museum, included as part of your 600￥ entry fee. Most signage is also in English, so you can get the full experience.

Jet Sng,2019-09-02 07:10:47,5,0,"The Phoenix Hall has an architecture like no other shrines, and you can tell that straight away, even if you're not well-versed in the different type of architecture style throughout the different periods of Japan. It's truly remarkable to look at from the front directly, and you can even enter it. (When it's not under construction, which it is as of 2 Sep 2019)

There's also a really well designed mueseum that is air-conditioned, that showcases the many different special attributes of this particular temple, such as the national treasure bronze bell that you can see right as you enter the mueseum.

Although the mueseum does lack some English descriptions, they do offer an audio guide app for 480 yen that is in English, so you can still enjoy the exhibits. It's highly recommended to get it, or you probably won't understand what most of the exhibits are about.

Last but not least, the town is also the origins of Japanese tea, and is very famous for its matcha,  so do try all the sweets and food around as well.

This is the shrine on your ¥10 coin. Located in uji around 20 minutes with train from kyoto station to uji station. You can find this shrine around 10 minutes walk from uji station. This place is not that huge so you can just allocate less than 1 hour. This city is also famous for their matcha so don't forget to buy one is you a big fan of matcha.

The only thing I didnt like was the high price. compare the size of garden and ¥600, I think it's kind of expensive. But I think it's because this place is famous and the temple is on ¥10 coin. If you want to enter the main building, you have to pay another ¥300 and wait for the visit time which occurs every 15 min.

If you have plenty of time, I suggest taking a walk around the river nearby.

Fujiwara no Michinaga, not as a temple. Michinaga's son turned Byodoin into a temple and ordered the construction of its most spectacular feature, the Phoenix Hall. Although the building was given another official name, almost immediately after its construction in 1053, it was nicknamed Hoodo (""Phoenix Hall"") because of its shape and the two phoenix statues on its roof.

Jackie Sakura,2022-12-02 07:30:27,5,3,"This is the mythical Byodoin, inspired the 10 yen coin! It has small garden grounds and a clear moat surrounding this godlike structure with giant Buddha. Inside is a museum of Buddha and Bohdasattva’s. But do you know the history of this temple?

In 1052, a Heian-period Regent received a villa from his father, and converted it into a Buddhist temple. This is the origin of Byodoin Temple. In the following year, Phoenix Hall was completed in whose interior sits the 2.4-meter-tall Amida Buddha (Amida Nyorai) created by Jocho, who is claimed to have been the very best Buddhist sculptor in the Heian period. It was at this time that Byodoin Temple reached its highest level of prosperity.

Some trees have a strange bulb - it is said to whisper at night. An enlightening experience! Until next time, Byodoin!

You can go in the Phoenix hall for 300yen (though we had to wait 90 minutes to get in, but you can walk around the palace grounds until your time to enter comes) but it is a single room with a ~15 minute long presentation purely in Japan.

Downside is that they wrap up quite earlier than the closing time. Even if you show up 45min before the end of business hours, you're likely to miss the Phoenix hall and not be allowed to enter the museum. So go early!

‫بدرية ”‪Maxine‬‏“ ك‬‎,2023-03-18 01:00:05,5,0,"The temple was smaller than I expected but it was nice to enjoy the calm heavenly ambiance. It has a museum that exhibits multiple wooden Buddhist statues which I really loved. Photos are not allowed inside the museum so you should check yourself! It was amazing to see them in Uji as I checked their replica before in another national museum. I didn’t choose to view the phoenix hall. I saw people were queuing every hour. The visitor group is formed of up to 40 people at a time.

Ben Hsu,2023-04-26 11:13:20,5,1,"A temple with well maintained garden and extremely modernized Buddhism museum with various 11th century artifices.

The garden has very different flowers in Spring and in Fall, and there are many photographers- amateurs and professionals- who visit Temple in Spring for target photo.

In 2023, entrance fee is 600 yen for garden and museum, while additional 300 yen for worship hall.

Visitors are recommended to try Uji tea culture and sweets, while Starbucks Coffee at nearby also has unique tea related products.

Visitors may take Keihan Mainline at Sanjo Station in Kyoto to Chushojima Station and transfer for Keihan Uji Line to last stop, Uji.

It was by far the most impressive Buddha I’ve seen in Japan. Completely made of wood and over 950 years old!! Note last admission is at 4:10PM. Museum last admission is 5PM.

If you want to visit the temple inside and admire the Buddha statue, you can but you have to pay extra and the visit lasts only 15 mins: there will be a guide who will take you to the only room with a majestic statue. However they don t tell you that the guide will only speak in japanese for almost 15 mins no stop.

I understand now because when you buy the tickets they tell you few times that they are not refundable, probably people have complained afterwards. A bit of more clarity and honesty would be appreciated.",no,,view review
kang hanqi,2023-05-22 06:52:38,4,0,"600 yen for adult entry was quite worth it since it included access to both the garden area and museum. You have to pay 300 yen more to enter the phoenix hall.

The phoenix hall itself makes for a great picture. The museum had several ancient artifacts that were interesting to see. Overall, would recommend those visiting Uji to drop by this temple.

Sander van Vliet,2023-06-08 14:39:36,5,0,"Only half an hour by train when departing from Kyoto's main train station. Uji is a city with a green tea and matcha history which is still visible when walking down the streets towards the temple. There are a lot of shops selling tea and tea products. The temple itself is beautiful, especially when the weather is good and the plants along the water are flowering. You can enter the garden, enter the temple itself (+¥300 and registration required) and visit the museum. The garden is not big, so don't expect to visit this place for a long time. The museum is attractive and worth visiting. There are some nice things to see over there, like the explanation of the representation of the bird on top of the temple. Compare the bird on the ¥10.000 Japanese bill and the bird on top of the temple. What do they have in common?
