We also opted to walk through the garden space which was 600 yen per person. I would highly recommend it as the scenery was lovely and well worth the money. Very peaceful space! Be sure to allow yourself at least one hour to really see the area if you're also planning on walking through the gardens.

Vu Thanh Ngoc Lan,2018-03-18 15:16:04,3,0,"Massive Torii gate that you can see from far away. Very spacious gate way but there's nothing to see inside as most of the halls are closed and you're not allowed to take photo in front of the main hall. No garden (or it didnt impress me much). So I would not recommend if you look for details and artworks but sure come in summer/autumn time (??) for festivals, events...

HsinHua Lai,2018-04-08 14:02:30,5,1,"I think it’s worth to paid to go inside! In the season of spring, cherry blossom blooming, so beautiful! And there got so many kinds of Sakura for you to see. In fall season, I think the maple tree will show very romantic view. And the environment is very comfortable, as you are walking inside, you can feel the power of nature! Also it holds Japanese traditional wedding so often, you can meet it sometime, to see how Japanese culture works is great.

I amaze with the tori gate by the entrance. Soo tall and big. It is huge area to explore. May is hot day to visit, so I suggest to prepare umbrellas if you want to go full visit of this Shrine.
The entrance building look beautiful.
Even though temple I visit look like the same, but I like this Heian Shrine as the trees around the temple give better view.
I might cone back to this place to explore all area.
Dint forget to bring sun glasses and hat or umbrella as you may need it.

I have nothing against the price, but since I already went to something similar in the same day, it was not worth to pay twice to basically see the same thing.

It can be quite dusty due to the gravel on the ground. The shrine is well maintained and has a beautiful red colour. You can make some awesome pictures with the trees in the foreground if you like. The garden which can be entered in the west side of the premises, has an entrance fee of ¥400-600 (not sure about the exact amount). If you think like, nahh, I have seen enough gardens. Again, this one is looking good with beautiful views and a passage over the water. Also, there is an old tram located in the garden itself. Something I haven't seen before. There are a few benches if you like to take some rest, different from the popular gardens where you are stuck to a mandatory walking direction without any places to sit down.
