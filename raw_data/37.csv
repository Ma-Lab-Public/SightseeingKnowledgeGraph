Robin Lenogue,2017-03-21 16:39:29,5,4,"Amazing 200 yen place. Really worth it. I highly recommend, whether for a picnic, a long half-day hike or a small walk around one of the areas, gardens or themed parts of them. 2 entrance, north and south, a cafe available in the middle, and more garden awesomeness in the covered place... But I'll keep that one for next time. Enjoy Sakura there!! 🤗

Chaz Pup,2017-06-14 16:34:08,5,2,"One of the best gardens I have been to in the world. Sprawling acres of meticulously maintained grounds with one of the larger conservatories. The conservatory itself houses multiple distinct climate regions with many unusual plants whose care is forefront. The day I was there they were having a Bonsai exhibition with one of the trees being over 500 years old.

Ask for the ""bloom of the week map"" to know where to see seasonal flower.  If you want a good inexpensive coffee, make a stop at the lawn cafetaria to enjoy a real terrace.

The gardens are huge and entry is only ¥200

The areas of the garden appear to be broken up into continents, with floral displays from everywhere scattered around the gardens.

We hired bikes and had a lovely ride along the river from Kyoto town centre, which made it super easy to get around and park in the gardens.

If you are looking for a timeout, this is a very good option.

Tintin Ng,2018-09-04 05:57:38,5,0,"During our visit to Kyoto Botanical Gardens, there was not much to see since we arrived summer time - more green, less color. Flowers were not in bloom. But still, I enjoyed it very much. We enjoyed our stroll around the garden with much less tourists. It was mostly quiet, with ducks, fish, and turtles swimming the pond, birds chirping, water fountain splashing. I would suggest going during the other seasons since it was really hot during summer. Additional entrance fee to convervatory was worth it with many flowers in different seasons and from different areas that are in bloom.

Monica Arciga,2018-10-21 07:44:58,5,0,"This is a beautiful serene place where you can take a stroll while looking at gorgeous flowers and greens. My 2- and 5- year olds loved it here because there were so many paths where they could explore and run. There are lots of benches everywhere where you can rest, eat a snack, read, draw, or simply enjoy a view. In the middle of the garden, there is a huge open green space with grass where many families were having a picnic and kids were playing. We had lunch at the cafe right next to the lawn area and then sat on the grass. The selection of food at the cafe was decent and prices were reasonable. We had no trouble getting an outdoor table. One last and pleasant surprise was the cute little playground on the grounds. The mushrooms are mini-librarires with many books in case your child just wants to chill out with a book (all in Japanese. but nice picture books).

Myra Pearson,2018-11-03 14:27:51,5,1,"Beautiful gardens well worth a visit.
To access the conservatory, you should arrive before 3:00pm.

In the conservatory you can see bromeliads, orchids, and other tropical plants as well as towering cacti.

They have a schedule of plants to see year round.

In the spring, you can see large peonies and sakura trees (cherry blossoms), as well as tulips and plum blossoms
In the summer there is a wide variety of flower to see.
In the fall, roses, large Japanese chrysanthemums, maple trees.

The outdoor gardens are quite spacious.

Also, an added bonus, is that it’s mostly full with locals and not tourists. It’s a bit farther up north, so it’s not a place that most tourists come and visit. But it’s absolutely stunning at all times throughout the year, as it has quite a large space, and there are so many varieties of flowers that bloom at different times of the year. Also, it’s a very popular place to take wedding photos, CUC many beautiful couples here.

Many majestic trees and flowering plants around the grounds. Some areas are seasonal (for example peonies are not in bloom in April, during cherry blossom season), but the conservatory contains splendid plants year-round and is huge, containing many sections with different climates.

Also on the grounds is a nice playground for kids, with all sorts of climbing opportunities.

Easy to reach by metro; follow the signs for the botanical gardens and you emerge right next to the Kitayama entrance to the garden. Very peaceful place to stroll and enjoy the beauty and diversity of flora!

Dave A,2023-04-19 05:27:55,5,0,"A beautiful in a beautiful Japanese town.  Rented a bike near Kyoto Station and rode north seeing a few temples.  This was the furthest stop north.  It was a bit rainy so the indoor cafe here was very welcome for coffee and soup.  So cheap, can't remember how much it cost.  Fee bike parking.  Large garden grounds including a very large conservatory showcasing different eco-systems and appropriate plants/trees indigenous to Japan as well as other tropic and even desert environments.  The real beauty though was in the long pathways (some paved, others, brick, dirt, etc.) through hidden coves and nooks with all kinds of small buildings, lakes, streams, trees.  There was also a formal large garden with fountains and atriums.  A gift shop ended the walk back to my bike.  Secret tip, the river next to this garden runs north-south with a wonderful bike path that will take you all the way back to Kyoto station.  If you want to avoid city traffic (can be a little daunting for those not accustomed to bike riding in Japan), you can take this bike path all the way north to the gardens.  Frankly, I'd gotten a bit tired of seeing another palace or temple by this time and would have just been thrilled alone to have seen this garden.

Reinaldo Jerez Contreras,2023-04-20 17:26:31,5,0,"The garden is very big. You can take your time and enjoy many different plants and flowers.

The entrance fee is rather cheap and most areas are in great shape (most).

There are plenty restrooms and vending machines to grab some snacks. There are also coin lockers at the entrance.

There is a dome of exotic plants which is very nice, it was open even after the published closing hours.

At the night it gets iluminated, but it is very close to the closing hours, yet it is very pretty.

A good experience if you have some spare time, but not a must-do by any means.

Nils Ferry,2023-04-26 01:31:24,5,0,"The Botanical Garden is a treasure of Kyoto where people of all ages can learn about botany and wildlife and mushrooms thrive. It needs NO perm. entertainment facilities, nor further restaurants that will detract from the magnificent natural setting. The facilities it has fulfill its mission. All it needs are picnic sheets and people.

D G,2023-04-29 03:48:24,5,1,¥400 entry for gardens + conservatory. Which is worth it for the conservatory alone. The gardens are a wide space and is a nice change of pace from the crowded tourist areas.,no,,view review
Fuzzy Life,2023-05-06 10:48:44,5,0,"Beautiful! There are a good variety of plants to see and the temperature/humidity are kept to the plant's requirements to thrive. Some sections are moderate, some hot and humid and some air-conditioned.",no,,view review

Brenda Ariesty Kusumasari,2023-05-20 00:32:11,4,0,"Looking for a place filled with greenery and peace in the middle of the city? This botanical garden is located just a bit on the north of the city centre and can be reached with a single bus ride in the direction of Kitaoji Bus Terminal. The entrance fee is only 200 yen for adults (free if you come with kid and have まもっぷ app). There are always flowers blooming every season so we can enjoy whenever we visit. There are vending machines, a restaurant, a cafe, a plant shop, and lots of benches to rest.

The place radiates serenity when we walk through the alley full of big trees. There are plenty of chairs too to rest when tired, and also the restroom. The price is only 200¥ per person and free for children.  Highly recommended.
