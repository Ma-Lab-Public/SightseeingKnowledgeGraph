KYOKO MACHIDA,2016-06-06 02:56:16,5,1,"One of the must visit shrines in Kyoto. It would be nice if you are able to experience Mitarashi Matsuri, which you can walk through in the river during this period only. The water is chilly, but it will be fun.",no,,view review
Trans-word plus TGM,2016-07-19 11:09:09,5,2,"You should definitely visit here for Yabusame held in the beginning of May and Mitarai Festival in the late July.

Yabusame ( Samurai Archery ) is a type of mounted archery in traditional Japanese archery. An archer on a running horse shoots three special ""turnip-headed"" arrows successively at three wooden targets.This style of archery has its origins at the beginning of the Kamakura period. Minamoto no Yoritomo became alarmed at the lack of archery skills his samurai had. He organized yabusame as a form of practice.

Mitarai Festival is another way called foot bathing ritual. You wade through a water path flowing through the sharine holding a candle to purify your feet. This area where the water path is flowing is called Mitarashi Pond and you can enter this pond only during this period. It is believed that you will be blessed with protection of god if you take part in this ritual during this period. ( Originally it was held to fight against plague of ancient times.) The charge is 300 yen and you will be given a candle to dedicate to the shrine. The water is very cold and so refreshing during this season of intense heat. After this ritual you will see a Mitarashi Dango ( a type of wagashi with mochi on a stick with soy sause based sause ) stall selling Mitarashi Dango. It might be a great choice before you leave the place. The event starts at 17:30 and finished at 22:00.

Ben Hsu,2017-12-28 01:59:16,4,1,"Shimogamo-jinja Shrine seems to be more popular for Japanese visitors than for non-Japanese visitors, probably because temple itself does not provide much English or other foreign language road signs or direction signs. The temple hall is often off access, because of various activities, such as wedding ceremony.

But, temple has one extremely attractive forest of broadleaf trees from public road to the temple hall. Many visitors seem to spend more time for taking photos with the ""forest"" than with the temple hall itself.

In addition to traditional gift or souvenir items sold in most of the temples, Shimogamo-jinja Shrine also has rice wine and other local items, such as candy or Japanese cookie sales a few times a year at the open space outside the temple gate.

To reach the temple, visitors have to take either bus or Keihan Rail, and bus waiting on rainy day, especially in holiday or weekend, can be difficult, and bus is often crowded. Thus, it is better to visit the temple on weekdays.",no,,view review

李明洋,2019-08-06 09:01:28,5,1,"Shimogamo Shrine is registered by the UNESCO as a World Heritage.  When we arrived at the Shimogamo Shrine in the evening, happened to meet a festival called ""Mitarashi festival"". Every year, during this period, there are many food vendors in front of the shrine to sell lots of delicious foods to visiting people,   just like the night market, very lively. It was more interesting to enter the shrine. Everyone here took off their shoes, walked into the cold pool, and then lighted the candles on the sides of the pool and made a wish. Then walked up the platform, dried the feet, put on shoes, and drunk the cold water named ""god water"" provided by the temple to complete the ceremony. Finally, we bought a Japanese amulet called ""Omamori"" that looked like a foot, very cute, and wrote a blessing on it. This was a very impressive experience.

賀茂御祖神社又名下鴨神社，是被聯合國教科文組織評定為世界遺產的一座神社。我們在晚上抵達下鴨神社，碰巧遇到被稱為""御手洗祭""的祭典。每年的這段期間，神社前面都會聚集許多攤商，販賣各式各樣的美食，讓前來參加祭典的遊客和信眾大快朵頤，宛如夜市一樣，非常熱鬧。進到神社，更有趣了。每個人都脫下鞋子，走進冰涼的水池裡，然後點燃水池旁的蠟燭，許願。接著走上平台，將腳擦乾，穿上鞋子，再喝下寺廟提供的神水，這樣就完成整個儀式。最後，我們買了一個外觀像腳一樣形狀的御守，在上面寫下祝福的話。這真是個令人印象深刻的經歷。

Senkan Koukuu,2019-09-06 13:05:42,4,3,"A huge shrine. There are about 10 or so different shrines in this 'Shimogamo' shrine. It doesn't cost anything to look around the shrine and there is a good forest surrounding it called Tadasu no Mori (糺の森, the forest of cleansing) so you could have some fun for a few hours with your family I guess.
However I do hope you are cultured enough NOT to let your kids into the stream surrounding the shrine like the couple I met when I visited. The shrine is sacred ground for the locals and a tourist attraction, not your babies' backyard. Moreover it kind of stinks to have humans pollute the nature at a tour site. Kids, even more so because they do not know etiquettes yet. I realized that they were taking pictures of their children playing but still, your kids may or may not be adorable to total strangers but let's not make the situation any worse.

At any rate the Shimogamo Shrine is to the northern end of the area. I added all the other shrines to google map though.
