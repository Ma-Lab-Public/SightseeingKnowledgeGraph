The Matadore,2018-04-14 11:37:00,5,0,"We went there as the sky was getting dark, and it was lightly raining, which in my opinion is the time to be there. I really appreciated this area especially under those circumstances. There were restaurants, beautiful buildings, trees on hills, and the lights along the path were lit, so the experience was quite magical. The shrine with the lanterns lighting everything around was beautiful. It was definitely a highlight for me.

Shingo Sae-Lim,2021-12-01 14:09:10,4,1,"(Trip was made back then on 1 Dec 2019, 2 years before the Covid-19 Pandemic hit)

Yasaka Shrine is one of Kyoto‚Äôs most iconic landmarks, with it‚Äôs beautifully elaborate main gate greeting you upon entering, to it‚Äôs distinctive central stage that looks even more amazing at night with the gentle glow of the lanterns.

Being one of the most famous shrines in Kyoto, they play host to the the Gion Matsuri during the summer festival, which is said to be the most famous festival for the whole country.

Though we weren‚Äôt able to experience it, we were still able to appreciate the temple‚Äôs beauty during our autumn trip to Kansai regions 2 years ago.

It‚Äôs conveniently located needy to Maruyamacho Park, Chionin Temple and Shorenin Temple which can be covered within the same day since they are in the same area and are worth a visit.
