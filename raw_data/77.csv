JOHN NG,2018-04-20 05:04:18,4,0,"I like this temple a lot. ~ ""Tōfuku-ji""

History : (Wikipeida)
Tōfuku-ji was founded in 1236 by the imperial chancellor Kujō Michiie.[2] He appointed the monk Enni as founding priest, who had studied Rinzai Zen Buddhism in China under the monk Wuzhun Shifan. The temple was burned but rebuilt in the 15th century according to original plans.

Features:

There are a number of gardens in the various precincts of Tōfuku-ji. The current garden was designed by landscape architect Mirei Shigemori in the 1930s. The moss garden in particular has been emblematic of the renewal of Japanese gardening principles in the 20th Century.

The temple features a large number of Japanese maple trees, and is most crowded during the autumn season when people flock to see the autumn foliage. It is a tradition to view the leaves from the Tsūten-kyō bridge.

Tofuku-ji is a renowned Buddhist temple located in the southeastern area of Kyoto City, Japan. Established in 1236, it holds immense historical and cultural significance, making it a popular tourist attraction.The temple comprises various buildings and gardens that showcase different architectural styles and periods of Japanese history. It is famous for its impressive Sanmon (main gate), which is one of the tallest and oldest of its kind in Japan dating back to the 17th century. Another notable feature is the Tofuku-ji Hojo - formally used as the head of Tofuku-ji control house.

Tofuku-ji also boasts scenic Japanese gardens, such as the Tsutenkyo Bridge Garden and the Maple Laves Garden that tower with fiery red autumn leaves in November. The latter is unlike no other with viewpoints that give Instagram-worthy shots.

The temple is additionally recognised for its serene atmosphere, presenting tranquil music during ceremonies, together with Buddhist art exhibitions at special times of the year. Visiting Tofuku-ji offers much more than just stunning scenery; It subtly includes learning about the Japanese religion of Buddhism while offering relaxing sanctuary on Wisteria Avenue (of Ashiyu hot spring), peace, and mindful contemplation amidst everyday bustling city life.

In summation, Tofuku-ji has embraced new importance over the years- finally transformed from ""a safe house"" to presently valued prayer center and a perfect blend of Japanese culture through serving tourism interests. Anyone who visits acquired subtle perception of Japan, serenity, embrace religious study, or indeed an ornate view for recreating moments in time.

The connecting bridge gives a breathtaking views of the foliage below, making it a must-visit for garden enthusiasts and nature lovers alike.

It is a 15 minute walk from the Fushimi Inari Shrine, which makes it easily accessible and convenient if you are visiting the temples in the Fushimi Ward. Although the temple is best appreciated during the peak of autumn, it still offers a serene experience outside of the season, with mossy trees and beautifully designed shrubs surrounding the temple grounds.

Definitely make this stop in your Kyoto visit, to take in the tranquility of this natural beauty.

Éamon M,2023-05-24 10:58:03,2,0,"Given that the aggregate ticket is a whopping ¥1000 for an independent visit that won't take long unless you sit down for a break, I would go with 2 stars. There really isn't much to see at this time of the year (May), it seems most of the satisfied visitors stopped by during specific times of the year when the foliage is a lot more interesting to stare at.

Of course, it may very well be that the management board has its own reasons for making the ticket so expensive, such as upkeep costs, etc. , but I have been to more memorable temples the ticket for which cost half as much.

Ironically, the best photos I took were all outside of the pay-to-enter area (the 2 star rating applies only to said area)

Robert E,2023-06-09 17:16:00,3,1,"The temple and grounds are pretty basic in terms of appearance and amenities. The main reason you come here is for viewing autumn colors. They have raised walkways that allow you to view over the treetops, which is gorgeous when the full spectrum of oranges and reds are on display. However, they have a rule where you can’t take pictures in these areas. This is a stupid rule to begin with, but even worse is that it isn’t enforced. When we went there were throngs of Chinese tourists hogging the railings, doing photo shoots that lasted several minutes per person. Feels disappointing for those of us that were following the rules, and left with neither a good view of the leaves nor a picture.",no,,view review
