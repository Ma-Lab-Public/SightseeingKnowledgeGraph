taicho -san,2018-06-23 17:34:03,3,17," Our most recent visit was late 2017. A place where the souls of the so-called Bakumatsu patriots rest. The remains of Ryoma Sakamoto, Shintaro Nakaoka, and his servant Fujiyoshi are buried. I was deeply moved by reading Ryotaro Shiba's ""Ryoma ga Yuku"" and started visiting graves. It was 43 years ago, and I was still in my late teens. Ryoma was very popular back then, but I don't think there were many people who came to see it as much as it is now. When I visited for the first time, I asked the shrine office where the cemetery was, and was given a map that looked like an old map. In front of Ryoma's grave, sake, 1,000 paper cranes, votive pictures, etc. were offered, and I remember that many business cards were placed. The number of sake offerings was not insignificant. I think that the people at the shrine must have had a hard time cleaning up. The atmosphere hasn't changed much in the past and now, but since many years ago, an admission fee has been required. There were pros and cons for Ryoma fans, but I understand that it was a disappointing but inevitable measure to maintain this Shoujoba. When I started visiting graves, the people around me didn't understand me, and they thought I was quite an oddball. There was no such word as grave mylar as it is today. This was my starting point, and since then I have visited historic sites related to the Meiji Restoration throughout Japan. By the way, in Yokosuka, where I live, there is a grave of Ryoma's wife Oryo (Shigaraki Temple), and I also visit the grave there. When there are movies and dramas featuring Ryoma, not just Taiga dramas, it becomes a boom, and after a few years it calms down. I was able to repeat that, but I feel that Masaharu Fukuyama's Ryoma has created an extraordinary boom. I have an actor who is a friend of mine, whose name I will withhold, and I also appeared in ""Ryomaden"", but when the appearance was decided, I was asked about the relationships surrounding Ryoma and the background of the times, and even here together. I even visited the grave.
Well, this is Gokoku Shrine. The enshrined deity is the country's heroic spirit. It is a place to commemorate and honor not only the patriots of the Meiji Restoration, but also those who died in the previous war, those who died in the Sino-Japanese War, and those who died for the country. Let's visit first and then climb. The basics are for you.
On the premises, there is also a monument honoring Dr. Bal, an Indian judge who was the only one who claimed Japan was innocent at the Tokyo Trials after the war. You can also see the city from the observatory.
I think that if you learn a little bit about this shrine, your impression will change greatly.
We recommend that you visit the temple at least once.

It is one of the gokoku shrines in Japan, and people from Kyoto were dispatched to the harsh battlefields of Burma and Okinawa during World War II.
In Burma, many soldiers died of malaria and starvation due to an unreasonable strategy that did not consider replenishment.
A certain division was forced to withdraw without the permission of the upper management, who did not respond to repeated requests for supplies. About 60,000 people were forced to cross the Chindwin River and returned, of which 2,000 were seriously ill requiring hospitalization, and about 400 died afterward. Died.
In the dense forests of Burma (now Myanmar), the remains are still exposed.

In the Battle of Okinawa, the Imperial General Headquarters transferred the 9th Division, the most elite division, to Taiwan. In defense, it became the main force in the first half of the Okinawa line.
The 62nd Division was a veteran, and despite the difference in military strength between us, it was able to stop the enemy several times more than us and gradually retreated the front line.
In Kakazu, one of the fierce battlefields in the first half, a monument of Kyoto was erected, and traces of the battle can be seen, such as the pillbox still remaining today.

Ryoma Sakamoto was one of the founding fathers of the Meiji Revolution (Restoration in Western Historiography) and he employed diplomacy and peace to unite tribes for the dream of a modern Japan.

His grave today does not reflect the greatness of this amazing, courageous, and prudent hero of Japanese history. But may his legacy, may we who agree with a modern Japan and peace, give him a bow.üáØüáµüóæ

For people who are interested in Japanese history, who want to learn about it, and who want to know the value of their own existence, I think this is a must-visit place when visiting Kyoto.
There is no doubt that it is thanks to the people who sleep here that Japan is at peace today.
It is located on a steep slope and has stairs, so I think it is difficult for people with disabilities to visit, but it is also a place that makes you think about the way people's hearts and the meaning of life are.
The view of modern Kyoto from this place, which has reached the end of a steep slope, also has the atmosphere of Kyoto in the Reiwa era.
I think it is a place where you can superimpose the capital of the past and the capital of Reiwa, and at the same time, you can reflect on your life.

pagi pagi,2021-11-04 07:33:16,5,6," About 15 years ago, I visited during a walk in Kyoto.

Ryoma Sakamoto, Kogoro Katsura, and many other patriots of the Meiji Restoration are buried here.

When I first went there, I was very impressed.
I don't know if Ryoma Sakamoto is really buried,
It's still a significant place.

There are pros and cons, but without Ryoma-san,
I don't think the Meiji Restoration happened.
Even if it did, it would have taken more time and more sacrifices.

Satsuma-Choshu Alliance, Restoration of Imperial Rule, Eight Plans in Ships,
I think that he was the one who seriously thought about the future of Japan from the bottom of his heart.

It's already difficult to go to Kyoto,
It's a place I want to visit again, and a place I want to think about slowly.

It was a rare gokoku shrine with a sacred mountain (cemetery). You don't need to pay to visit the shrine, but you need to pay an entrance fee to enter the sacred mountain (cemetery). Adults are 300 yen per person. However, if you come this far, you will want to enter the mountain. There are graves of Ryoma Sakamoto and Shintaro Nakaoka. There are steep slopes and stairs, so high heels are unreasonable lol
Ryoma and Shintaro were standing next to each other. From the grave of Ryoma and others, we could see Kyoto city.
In recent years, there have been various theories about the Meiji Restoration, but what is the truth? is not it.
In any case, I came back with my thanks for being born in modern Japan as a Japanese, and my thanks to the spirits of the spirits for allowing me to continue to live.
When I left the shrine and walked down the slope, the sunset was so beautiful that I took a picture of it too.

We recommend that you come in clothes that you can exercise because it is normally in the mountains. The main items are located along the well-maintained approach to the shrine, but basically you have to go up and down the stairs.
