ÈªÑÁ∑ë„ÉªÁ∑ë„ÉªÈùíÁ∑ë,2018-11-09 13:09:28,5,8," It has become my favorite temple since I visited the Jotenkaku Museum many years ago. Located in the depths of Doshisha, this temple is easily overlooked unless you visit it with a purpose in mind. (That being said, I was one of them.)
Even if you visit by car, the parking lot is free, and above all, it is within walking distance from the subway station, so there is no need to take a crowded city bus, so there is no stress about access.
The pine trees in the precincts are very beautiful, and their various forms are pleasing to the eye. Even though it is located in the city of Kyoto, it is quiet, and there are few tourists, so you can take a leisurely stroll. We are looking forward to the special openings in spring and autumn, but you can also visit the Jotenkaku Museum in other seasons! Then, stroll around the precincts to see the pine trees.
(*As is the case here, even though photography is prohibited inside the building, there are still some people who cannot follow the rules of visiting the temple to take pictures just because no one is looking. I once came across a scene where the driver recommended that I take a picture because no one was looking at it in a place where photography was prohibited.
People talk about the guides, but in my case, they are always kind to me. Just like other people are like mirrors, at any temple, if you first say hello when visiting and confirm exactly where to take pictures, the people who will respond are uniformly kind. Still, if there is a great deal, I will post a review!

Camry 2104,2018-12-20 13:27:10,5,3," It is a great temple with Kinkakuji and Ginkakuji as sub-temples, but Shokokuji, the main temple, is not so conspicuous in Kyoto today. However, you can feel the afterglow of the time when Yoshimitsu Ashikaga built it at the height of the Muromachi Shogunate and had a seven-storied pagoda with a height of 109 meters.
Personally, I recommend starting from the north wall of the imperial palace, passing through the Imadegawa gate, reaching the main gate of Shokokuji with Doshisha's stylish brick campus on either side, and going straight from the north of Hojoike. Then, Toyotomi Hideyori's rebuilt Buddhist temple, which is said to be the largest in existence, rises majestically in front of you. It is spectacular with the feeling of a true hit appearance. I don't think you can experience the strangeness of this landscape change anywhere else.
The Banryu-zu drawn by Mitsunobu Kano, who is known for the cry of the dragon, is also splendid. The reverberation that resonates with a snap is also wonderful, and I feel like my body is tightened.
I think the Jotenkaku Museum is the best museum of its kind, and if you visit here too, you can spend half a day at your leisure.

Shokoku-ji Temple is the head temple of the Shokoku-ji school of the Rinzai sect, and its mountain name is Mannenzan.

In the second year of Eitoku (1382), Yoshimitsu Ashikaga, the 3rd shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate, requested the construction of a large Zen monastery on land adjacent to the Hana no Gosho. It was completed in 1392, 10 years later.

Â••ÊùëÊÖé‰πüÔºàOK computerÔºâ,2021-03-31 11:54:21,4,8," This Zen temple is associated with the Ashikaga shogunate, the Fushimi-no-miya family, and the Katsura-no-miya family, and is ranked second among Kyoto's five great temples. Shokoku-ji Temple is the center of Gozan Literature, and painter monks Shubun and Sesshu are from Shokoku-ji Temple. Rokuon-ji (Kinkaku-ji) and Jisho-ji (Ginkaku-ji), which are well-known sightseeing spots in Kyoto, are sub-temples of Shokoku-ji.

In 1382, the third shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate, Yoshimitsu Ashikaga, proposed the construction of a large Zen temple on land adjacent to the Hana no Gosho. It was completed in 1392, 10 years later.
Yoshimitsu requested Myohan Haruya, a Zen master, to become the founder of the temple, but Myoha firmly declined. He replied that if Soseki, the master of Myohan, was to be the founder, he would be happy to become the second chief priest, so Soseki became the founder. Of course, the second chief priest Myohan also died in 1388 without seeing the construction of Shokoku-ji Garan completed. Meiou Karatani was appointed as the third chief priest on the recommendation of Shushin Gido, another Zen master. Meio Karatani served as chief priest three times, and when most of the temple was destroyed in a fire in 1394, two years after the temple was completed, he returned to the position of chief priest and worked on the rebuilding at the request of Yoshimitsu.
Many fires occurred after that, and it burned down again in 1425. In the first year of Onin (1467), Shokoku-ji was burned down during the Hosokawa side's encampment during the Onin War (the Battle of Shokoku-ji). In 1551, it was caught in a fight between Harumoto HOSOKAWA and Nagayoshi MIYOSHI and burned down (the Battle of Shokoku-ji Temple), so far it has been burned down four times. In 1584, Jota Saisho, who is said to be the founder of the restoration of Shokoku-ji Temple, became the chief priest and proceeded with the restoration. The existing temple was built during this period. After that, there was a fire in 1620, and in 1788, most of the halls except the main hall were destroyed in the 'Great Fire of Tenmei'. Most of the existing cathedrals were rebuilt during the Bunka era in the early 19th century.
Also, the seven-tiered pagoda built by Yoshimitsu in 1399 was destroyed by lightning in 1403, but the seven-tiered pagoda boasts a total height of 109.1m (spire height), the tallest in history. It is a tall Japanese-style pagoda. For about 515 years until the completion of the large chimney (155.7m high) of the Hitachi Mine in 1914, the record for the tallest structure in Japan was not broken. The seven-storied pagoda was relocated to Kitayama Sanso (later Rokuonji) and rebuilt (Kitayama Daito), but it was destroyed by lightning again in 1416 after Yoshimitsu's death. The third pagoda, which was rebuilt at the original location of the temple, was again destroyed by lightning in 1470.
In the past, there was Rokuon-in, a government office that supervised temples below Gozan as the de facto highest institution of the Rinzai sect. Since Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA appointed Nakatsu ZEKKAI, the head of Rokuon-in Temple, as Soroku, the head of the temple also served as Soroku and wielded power as Rokuon Soroku. It was abolished in the early Meiji period due to the anti-Buddhism storm.

The large precincts are lined with splendid buildings, including the Hatto and Hojo. In particular, the large and gorgeous bell tower, Koonro, is eye-catching.

Founded by Yoshimitsu Ashikaga, the third shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate, this famous temple is ranked second among the five great temples of Kyoto. It is the head temple of the Shokokuji school of the Rinzai sect.

It seems that Yoshimitsu was the one who established the Kyoto Gozan. Nanzen-ji Temple was designated as the top of the Five Mountains, and Tenryu-ji Temple, Shokoku-ji Temple, Kennin-ji Temple, Tofuku-ji Temple, and Manju-ji Temple were designated as Kyoto's Five Mountains. Kamakura also has five mountains.

Although it is not generally known because it has not become a tourist spot, there are many sub-temples adjacent to the precincts, and that Kinkaku-ji and Ginkaku-ji are also sub-temples of Shokoku-ji.

It's very manga-like, so I recommend watching the Onin Ran arc on YouTube. By the way, Hatakeyama Masanaga was killed by another Western Army unit and ran away. We're just having a really hot fight here. It seems that the width of the road to Shokokuji Temple is the same as in the Muromachi period, so you can feel the heat of the chest as the east and west units fought here.

The Hatto, Hojo, and Kaisando can only be visited during special visits in spring and autumn. The worship fee is 800 yen.

It is read as Shokokuji. Founded in 1392 by Yoshimitsu Ashikaga, it is the head temple of the Shokokuji branch of the Rinzai sect of Buddhism. There are Kinkaku-ji and Ginkaku-ji in the sub-temple, but now the sub-temple is more famous.

Banryuzu is painted on the ceiling of the hall. It is a so-called ‚Äúcrying dragon‚Äù, and when you clap your hands, you can hear a unique reverberation sound.

There are many ceiling paintings of dragons in Zen temples, but the reason is that the dragon is a guardian deity that protects Buddhism, and it protects the building from fire by calling clouds and rain.

The dragon of Shokokuji was drawn by Toyotomi Hideyori in 1605 when the temple was rebuilt, and the staff said that it is the oldest one in existence.

Despite this time of year, the leaves were still visible. There were several dry landscape gardens, and it was full of highlights. If you just want to enter the precincts, you can visit all year round, but we recommend visiting during the special worship season.
