Silver Navigation,2017-04-17 01:37:22,5,0,"Ninomaru-goten Palace, consisting of six connected buildings. Amazing trip back to history of The Tokugawa family and the Shogunate, and what a great planning of the space. Subtle sounds of floors creaking (and alerting the Inhabitant), as you explore.

Wahyu Adiputra,2018-01-22 07:53:11,5,0,"I spent 2 hours to explore this place. The castle and the gardens were so amazing. Very recomended, the location is in central Kyoto. The easy access from Kyoto Station is by using bus no 101 to Nijojo Mae Bus Stop in front of the main gate of the castle. It will be more interesting to visit Nijo Castle when autumn or spring season.

Alexander,2018-04-08 10:15:36,1,0,"Total disappointment. Huge crowds. You are only allowed to walk along a predefined path, you cannot enter rooms in the castle and free walk in the garden. The rooms are empty and all look similar (just tatami, same size, no furniture whatsoever).
There’re many more interesting things in Kyoto. Don’t waste your time here.",no,,view review
Bruno Schwizer,2018-04-12 13:53:39,3,1,"Giving this a 3 of 5 because there were a lot of places off limits and there was a decent entry fee.  The main highlight was this building where a lot of history took place.  People are directed along the inside perimeter of the building to peek into the various rooms and then go back out.  The signs are well labelled in English also and the history is imoressive but if you are on a tight schedule, other items on Kyoto may take priority.  There was also a night show advertised with some projectors for a limited time.  Crowds were busy shortly before lunch on a weekday.  No drones allowed.

Jing Wu,2023-03-25 11:11:15,5,1,"The entrance fee is 1300 yen for general admission. When we went there, only the Nijo Castle Ninomaru Goten (Second Palace) was open. Despite that, it was worth visiting. You are not allowed to take pictures indoors, so just take it in as much as you can. The structure of the palace was amazing and you get to see how each room looks like. There are different paintings on the wall and it pairs with the function of each room. There are sliding doors in the corridor and you can picture how much brighter the hallway would be when the doors are opened. Look up the ceiling and you can also see different patterns of paintings. Just for this palace, it was worth entering.

There wasn't really a wait when we were there around 11 on Saturday, but when we got out around 2pm there was a long line.
