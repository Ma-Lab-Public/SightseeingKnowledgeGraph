But we made it. Not much food in the area either. But as for the shrine, great. This is an Ichinomiya shrine, along with Shimogamo. Both have beautiful grounds. I especially liked that this one was associated with Eto, or Zodiac animals.

I went at my wife's request.
It was my first time to visit a shrine in Kyoto, and I realized that the atmosphere of each shrine is different depending on the region, formality, and purpose.
The color is the same as that of Hinomisaki Shrine, and the green frame gives a pleasant accent.
But personally, I'm only interested in old shrines.
I was conscious when I had a lot of scenery that I wanted to shoot rather than visiting the shrine...
The toilet was amazing.

Today we were blessed with fine weather and visited the shrine.

m koba,2022-06-06 14:04:24,5,1," This is Kamigamo Shrine, one of Kyoto's World Cultural Heritage Sites.
As the oldest shrine in historical Kyoto, it has long been revered by the emperor.
An ancient shrine with a long history, said to have been visited by many famous warlords from ancient times, including Kyoto, as well as Nobunaga Oda and the Tokugawa family.
The official name is Kamowakeikazuchi Shrine, as the name suggests.
It is said to be a god with power strong enough to separate thunder.
If the god that governs thunder is the god of thunder, then the god itself surpasses even that!
Since ancient times, it has been worshiped as a god of warding off evil, warding off disasters, and ensuring victory.
By all means, please visit while researching this historic shrine ^ ^
Another pleasure is the Futaba hollyhock, a plant that grows naturally in the precincts of the shrine.
Speaking of Aoi, it is said to be one of Kyoto's three major festivals.
Some people may imagine the Aoi Festival, but there is another Aoi.
Mitsuba Aoi, the family crest of the Tokugawa family, who succeeded in unifying the whole country and established the Edo period, which lasted for 260 years.
The family crest of the Tokugawa family and Kamigamo Shrine have a long history, and it seems that there are many important items in old books that unravel the history.

On the walls of the buildings of the main hall and Gonden, there are paintings that look just like the statues.

一心太郎丸,2023-04-04 03:47:52,5,1," I've been to Kyoto several times in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, but this was my first time visiting during the cherry blossom season. When I searched Google for the purpose of seeing the name tree of the hanging cherry tree, I found that Kamigamo Shrine has several name trees, so I decided to go 😅 (It is a famous shrine, but it is far from the center It's inconvenient to travel around Kyoto) I happened to stay at a hotel near Gion Shijo, so I could go by Keihan and bus for about an hour. It took more than an hour to get to the station, so I think it's important for people who want to go around various places to go to the station. It is high, and Shikinen Sengu is being carried out, and is it a signboard for the dedication of the Emperor and the imperial family? This suggests that it is a shrine that has long been associated with successive generations of the imperial family. I didn't count the hanging cherry blossoms, but there are many that have names, and there are many old trees, and the blooming season seems to differ depending on the cherry tree. ❗It can be said that it is an inconvenient place for those who want to visit several places in one day, but if you have a purpose like me, I think it is one of the shrines that you will be satisfied with. (^-^) v I intended to visit representative shrines such as Ise Jingu, but it was the first time I saw a sacred horse inside even if there was a sacred stable.❗ It was a fresh feeling. Ta ⤴️

かもちゃん,2023-04-17 10:45:56,5,1," I came with my daughter who is visiting 22 shrines.
I was doing a test run of Kamigamo Horse Racing on May 5th. I saw it about 10 years ago and it was amazing.
There seems to be a wedding ceremony, and I was able to see the bride and groom.
I wish you good luck.

しまたろう,2023-04-24 05:18:15,5,1," I often go to the handmade market held on the fourth Sunday of every month.

The precincts are wrapped in a dignified atmosphere, and there is a lot of greenery that will soothe your soul.

It's fun to see the wonderful works of handmade artists, listen to various stories, and eat the bread I bought in nature.

Yuchuva,2023-04-25 06:08:27,5,0," It was a beautiful and majestic shrine.
I didn't have a chance to visit, but I was able to stop by because I was going to Shodenji.

The front of the torii was well maintained and the parking lot was wide, so I didn't have any trouble visiting.

The creek inside the shrine is so clear and relaxing.

On the night I visited, I felt a connection with the rumble of thunder.

tsunemasa ohara,2023-05-12 15:47:13,5,0," I went to Kamigamo Shrine. The cherry blossom season is very beautiful, and I love the weeping cherry blossoms here. It wasn't the cherry blossom season this time, but the garden was wide and the river was flowing, so it was a very relaxing space.
Amulet soil was sold. I think it's probably in the northeast position where it's good to wind it in a bad place.If you live in a detached house, please use it.
