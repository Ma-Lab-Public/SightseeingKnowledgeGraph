Mr Bob,2016-05-10 09:48:34,5,0,This quiet little temple complex would be easy to overlook but you would find the short walk getting here well worth the effort. I visited many temples during Golden Week but I was most impressed with the simplicity and natural beauty of this place. The surrounding gardens are well laid out and not over tended. So many places have swarms of workers really overdoing the groundskeeping. This garden is in great condition but not overdone and very natural looking.,no,,view review

Erin Noxon,2017-06-03 06:21:43,5,2,"What a gorgeous hidden gem! Called the Green Maple, there are so many colors of green that you can't name them all. The Moss is so gorgeous and I can't wait to go in the fall to see the maples when they change color! Such a beautiful place, just off the beaten path. I can't believe I left the super crowded main street and there was hardly anyone here. Perfect place to feel at peace... And what a great view!",no,,view review

Luca Cortese,2017-11-12 22:24:29,5,0,"Amazing temple in Arashiyama, one of the best in the area, in my humble opinion. And it‚Äôs very close to bamboo grove and Okochi Sanso Villa Gardens. These pictures have been taken in late October 2017, too early for Autumn foliage sadly.

Thomas C,2017-11-26 14:16:23,4,0,"A very picturesque shrine with good foliage. The stairs leading up to the temple are one of its most photographed scenes.

YJ C,2018-09-10 11:14:15,5,1,"If you only do one temple in Kyoto, this is the one to go to.
On a rainy September morning at 10am, I was nearly the only person wandering the grounds, so I had the viewpoint at the top all to myself. This is probably closer to how temples are meant to be experienced, than as part of a never ending crowd.
Incredible greens on the mossy hills and so many trees sprawling over the stone steps - how can anyone not find this beautiful?",no,,view review
Ben Hsu,2018-10-31 11:31:15,5,1,"The temple has beautiful garden and moss on the ground. The maple leaf season of the temple is around late October to mid November, and it is very crowded especially in weekend.  Temple is not extraordinarily large, but its garden is extraordinarily excellent and has high reputation among local Japanese and Japanese garden designers for its moss, tree garden, and fall maple leave beauty.

While temple has very beautiful garden, the temple does not have much religious worship or chatting practice.  It appears that the temple is selling its garden as a tour attraction, and visitors can enjoy garden beauty with serenity.

It takes about 20 minutes of walking distance from Arashiyama Randen train station to the temple, and most popular route is to walk through famous Arashiyama Bamboo Gloves trails.

The temple does not have handicapped access or parking, because the temple was built on mountain slope and requires moderate mountain steps climbing.  However, visitors have options to climb up mountain steps straight line directly or go up on ""Z"" shape step climbing, which is more suitable for the seniors.

The temple does have toilets, but no vending machine or gift shop selling any drink.  Although there's a coffee shop near the temple, it does not open on some weekdays. Thus, visitors should prepare for or bring their own drinking water, especially in summer and other hot days.",no,,view review
