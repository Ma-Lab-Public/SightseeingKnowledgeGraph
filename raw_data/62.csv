The enormous, imposing and gigantic gate is jaw dropping. If you're up for it, climb the ""Great Bell"" The grounds are free, but the gardens require a admission fee.",no,,view review
Susan Peterson,2016-04-02 13:53:48,4,1,"Beautiful temple and grounds. When I visited, there were monks chanting and you could hear them all throughout the temple. Another point of interest (if you are feeling energetic!) is the small cemetery.  Free entry but if you want to visit the gardens; there is a fee. Best way to get there is by bus and stop is close to the entrance. Just be warned you will need a reasonable level of fitness as the steps are quite steep.",no,,view review

Jamie Palliser,2018-04-28 10:30:12,3,1,"Probably the more disappointing temple/shrine visited on our trip - we knew that the main area was closed until 2019 for restoration but it does make the whole area like a building site. To go with that the gardens are closed until late May 2018 too, and the other visitor area is for members/VIP only so really all you can see until may is the worshipping room and the big bell. The bell is huge and good for a 20 minute look around the place is you're nearby, but I wouldn't travel to see this place, many better ones in the Kyoto area.

Touched the big belfry which is one of the Japan three biggest belfry.
This belfry is rang 108 times on new years eve from 11pm to 1am.
The bel is so big that 17 monks get their powers to ring it every 1 minute.

Shingo Sae-Lim,2021-12-01 14:33:18,4,0,"(Trip was made back then on 1 Dec 2019, 2 years before the Covid-19 Pandemic hit)

Chionin is the head temple of the Jodo sect of Japanese Buddhism and is one of the most popular Buddhist sects in Japan.

The Sanmon Gate is the largest wooden gate in Japan and the impressive scale sets the tone of the equally spacious grounds and large buildings inside.

Thought it might not be as outstanding as Yasaka Shrine, it’s still impressive in it’s own way and worth a visit if you have time.

When we revisited Chionin on Sunday night 2 years ago on 1 Dec 2019, it was the last day of their night illumination, and unfortunately the autumn foliage night illumination was very lacklustre, most likely because it’s already the start of winter and most of the trees have already shed their leaves. Probably would have been better if we were here during mid- November when it was still the peak season.

Nevertheless, the lighting effect was much better than Eigenji’s, as Chionin was better at highlighting the building features and landscape.
