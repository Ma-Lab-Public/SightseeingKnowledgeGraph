saw sim ong,2018-01-06 10:37:36,4,0,"The visit to the imperial palace is free but you have to make sure that a booking is made online prior to your arrival. Alternatively you can make a visit to the palace to make an advance booking to be sure that you get a place. The third alternative is take a chance and queue up on the morning or afternoon of the visit as the administration gives out a number of places on the day itself. You get to visit the palace grounds but don't get a peek at the castle at all. Grounds are well main and beautiful and we had the pleasure of vibrant autumn colours although it was the beginning of December 2017

Dávid Kovács,2018-07-06 17:46:45,4,1,"First of all, my rating is for the park only. As we arrived 25 minutes before closing we were not allowed to enter and based on what we read about the palace we decided not to return there next day.

As for the park, it's really huge, nice and quiet. At least after 4 p.m. You can take a long walk there virtually alone and also take some cool pictures. It's always nice to have a place like this in a big city.

Arella Bailey,2019-03-06 20:28:22,5,1,"Even though I went when most of the place was already closed up for the day it was still a really pretty place. The grounds have a few shrines on them you can look at and everything is surrounded by trees and benches for people to sit. Lots of people like to bring their dogs for walks in the evening and you can find lots of stray cat wandering around too.

Steven Joe,2019-05-02 09:13:39,4,2,"A pretty large open combination of palace houses and other structures. A nice big park attached to it. A pretty nice garden that showcases some of the traditional Japanese methods. It was nice that it did not cost anything to enter and walk around the grounds. Definitely worth seeing but not going to be too exciting. Highly recommend this on a dry day. There is a pretty decent restaurant nearby and clean facilities to use. You can also bring your own lunch and use the picnic tables just outside of the Palace.

Elias Chelala,2021-05-25 12:46:40,4,2,"The Kyoto Imperial Palace (Kyoto Gosho) was the residence of the Japanese emperors until 1869, when the capital was moved to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration. The palace can be traced back to the late 8th century. This site served as the permanent imperial palace for over 500 years.

Damian Newton,2023-02-16 04:27:47,5,20,"It's hard to appreciate the size and scale of the main buildings and palace gates. Each structure is huge, and the detail that goes into crafting the buildings is impressive.

We cycled to the palace from a bike rental place near Kyoto Station. The ride was easy, and navigating to the palace and surrounding gardens was a breeze. Definitely a great way to get a feel for the city, and a nice break from taxis and trains.

Admission is free, just need a mask and temperature check for entry. There is car and bike parking, and a waiting room with free lockers for your bags etc if needed.

There is a free app to download for English tour information which is helpful. And each main building has a sign with additional information about the structure.

It took around and hour to walk around everything, but mileage may vary based on your pace. It was snowing when we where there, so we walked rather briskly.

Definitely worth a visit when you're in Kyoto.

HedgeHodge “HodgePodge”,2023-03-05 07:37:16,5,7,"I’ve been to the Imperial Palace several times without getting to go inside due to holidays and other events. Today I finally got to enter. Admission is free.
Now I will say that if was being less lenient, I’d actual rate this place 4 instead of five stars. That’s only for the fact that a non history person will most likely not enjoy this place that much. Compared to Nijo, the buildings of the palace are somewhat modest, with the orange gates being the exception. The gardens and buildings are still historical and beautiful and the groups keepers are doing a excellent job maintaining the premise.
The Imperial Palace is definitely a historic treasure that I’d recommend a visit if your Kyoto for more than 3 days. If your trip is short though and your not Uber into history, you can probably pass.

Syed Obaidullah Hussaini,2023-04-04 00:15:12,4,0,"The Imperial Palace of Kyoto, also known as the Kyoto Gosho, is a stunning palace complex located in Kyoto, Japan. It was the residence of the Emperor of Japan until 1868, when the capital was moved from Kyoto to Tokyo. The palace is situated in a large park-like area, surrounded by beautiful gardens and water features. Visitors can take a tour of the palace and learn about the history and culture of Japan.

The palace complex consists of several buildings, including the Shishinden, the Seiryoden, the Kogosho, and the Otsunegoten. The Shishinden is the main building of the palace, and it was used for important ceremonies and events. The Seiryoden was used as a banquet hall, while the Kogosho was used as a residence for the empress. The Otsunegoten was the residence of the emperor and his family.

The architecture of the palace is a beautiful blend of traditional Japanese style and Chinese influences. The buildings are constructed with natural materials such as wood, paper, and stone, and are decorated with intricate carvings and paintings. The roofs are adorned with beautiful tiles and copper fittings, and the interiors are decorated with traditional Japanese art and furnishings.

Visitors to the palace can take a guided tour, which includes a visit to the Shishinden and the Seiryoden. The tour guides provide fascinating insights into the history and culture of Japan, and visitors can learn about the life of the emperor and his family. The gardens surrounding the palace are also open to the public, and visitors can stroll through the beautiful landscaped grounds and admire the stunning scenery.

One of the highlights of the palace is the beautiful cherry blossom trees, which bloom in the spring and attract visitors from all over the world. The palace is also illuminated at night, creating a magical atmosphere that is truly unforgettable.

Overall, the Imperial Palace of Kyoto is a must-visit destination for anyone interested in Japanese history and culture. The beautiful architecture, stunning gardens, and fascinating history make it a truly unique and memorable experience.

This is a a must do, the grounds are absolutely huge and you can freely walk in around the palace grounds, you can even picnic, there are a couple of kids playgrounds and lots of gardens and blossoms to sit under.
Couple of things to note,
- The roadways inside the grounds are all gravel so it can be tricky pushing prams or riding bikes.
- Check the weather, if it’s clear sky definitely bring a hat, same if over-cast an umbrella as it’s a good 15 min walk in.
- Consider exiting the grounds at the rear or on the sides, you will come out in more of suburbia and it’s actually nice walking back to central Kyoto through the local neighbourhoods, you’ll pass schools and typical housing which is all very pleasant.

The whole place has a very zen feeling to it if you take your time to discover it
Rest areas offer nice snacks and refreshments

Vincent Biret,2023-05-28 23:42:53,5,1,"The place is huge which means even when it's crowded, it doesn't look like it is. The gardens were beautiful and the buildings are full of interesting details if you pay attention.

Yingying,2023-05-31 11:39:17,4,0,"Free entry to the palace. It’s huge so we spent around 1 hour there. At the end, there is also a rest area for you to sit and have a drink. Overall good experience.

The Gal Travels,2023-06-01 01:11:03,5,2,"This is one of my favourite places in Kyoto. I particularly enjoy the massive garden, perfect for walking and enjoying nature and fresh air. There is a main walking path which is made of loose gravel, or the shaded  grass path between the trees (which we found later to be more comfortable for walking and shade). Entry to the palace is free and it’s just so pleasant and spacious to walk from one building to they next. They even have chairs at certain stops so people can rest.

Lamp Shades,2023-06-04 07:46:36,1,0,"Online says it closes at 5:00 but last entry is at 4:20. It doesn’t say that online so we arrived only a few minutes late and weren’t allowed to enter. This was one of main sites in Kyoto that we wanted to see. It’s ridiculous that it says it closes at 5:00 but no one is allowed to enter 40 minutes before. Either make it more clear that last entry is 4:20 or just say it’s closed at 4:20. “Closes at 5:00” is extremely misleading and annoying. If there’s no entry past 4:20, THEN IT’S CLOSED.",no,,view review

Antonio Vidal Carrasco,2023-06-08 13:14:54,5,1,"Great walk around the Palace with free entry and free audoguide in your phone from the official app. You can download the app in the waiting room and after the first ""use"" it works offline with high GPS precision.
The audoguide is quite good and with good explanations.

The staff is very friendly and you can ask them things about the place if you know some Japanese or basic English questions.

Definitely better than Nichio Castle in my opinion.

Robert E,2023-06-09 17:07:25,3,0,"The big improvement they could make is to the entry system for the buildings in the complex. The entry to the buildings is controlled and last entry is at 2 pm, even though the complex closes at 5 pm. Doesn’t make sense to me that they’d need that much time to make sure everyone has vacated by closing time. However, even if you can’t get into the buildings, the grounds are still nice and are free to enter.",no,,view review
