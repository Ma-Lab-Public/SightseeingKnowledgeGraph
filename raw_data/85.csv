Êûó‰º∏ÂΩ¶,2022-02-16 04:35:50,4,9," There is a parking lot at the foot of the mountain under the temple at Saigoku Sanjusansho Fudasho.
When I came here before, I remember climbing a lot of stone steps, so I was prepared, but unfortunately it is currently under construction, so I will have to go up the slope in front of me. (It's not long, but it's a nice slope no less than stairs.)

There were not many worshipers in the precincts of the main hall, partly because of the corona disaster.
I thought this time as well, but next time I will come in the hydrangea season.
The hydrangea garden in the mountains in the precincts is definitely worth seeing during the best season.

It's not the season yet, but the well-maintained cedars and other trees looked very nice.

ÂÆÖË¶ãËÇá,2022-03-04 01:39:36,5,24," Located 15 minutes from Keihan Mimuroto Station, it was built in the Houki era (770-781) at the request of Emperor Konin.
For lovers of Buddhist statues, there is a treasure house (open once a month, paid), where important cultural properties such as the statue of Amida Nyorai, the wooden statue of Shaka Nyorai, and the wooden statue of Bishamonten are enshrined.

Mimurotoji Temple has many profit spots, so I think it's good to remember the points...
Go through the temple gate and climb the stairs to ""Mimurodo"". After purifying your hands, it is said that you should touch ``Ugajin'' and ``Hosho-gyu'', ``Fukutoku-usagi'' and ``Ryu-no-kashira'' in front of the main hall, all of which are auspicious. You can also see Wakanohana and Takanohana's handprints, perhaps because of their luck. Many omikuji and ema are lined up for women.

Next to the main hall is the Amida hall, bell tower, and three-storied pagoda. It's a detour, but you should stop by.

One more thing, you can enjoy various flowers here as it is said to be a flower temple. The garden ""Yorakuen"" is famous. The 5,000 tsubo dry landscape garden created by Kinsaku Nakane and the strolling pond garden are filled with azaleas and hydrangeas. It's not blooming now, but I can imagine it.

In March 2022, now plum blossoms, 250 Tarebaien open. The woman at the reception at the entrance of Mimurotoji Temple asked me, ""The plum blossoms are starting to bloom. Are you okay?"" The entrance fee of 800 yen was a little consideration.

Ah, it's okay, there are few customers, and the scenery overlooking the plum blossoms is all for one person, so I'm satisfied enoughüëç

Ëä±È≥•È¢®ÈâÑ,2022-03-13 02:00:01,4,1," In the spring of 2022, the weeping plum garden will open. There are 250 red and white weeping plum trees planted in the park, and they have a nice fragrance. It is a pleasant place with a good view on the slope of the mountain that opens to the direction of Uji city. There is also a teahouse, so you can take a break while looking at the plum blossoms.

The grounds were very large and gave the impression of being a light entertainment spot. It might be nice to find your favorite hydrangea.

It was a very beautiful temple on the premises, and it was a wonderful temple with many attractions.
However, the entrance fee is expensive, there is a shop at the exit on the way back (the green tea was quite delicious), and the staff at the temple, including the stamps and the posters, make it a temple that attracts a lot of visitors.

This time, we will receive a direct-written goshuin and a limited-time-only goshuin.
I also found a heart shape in the three-storied pagoda, and the tension went up!
There are relatively few visitors, so you can take your time and look for heart-shaped hydrangeas. It's still a little ahead of the best time to see the 5th part. There is a teahouse in the garden and you can enjoy sweets.
The exit is a revolving door, so if you are in a wheelchair, you will have to exit through the entrance.

I enjoyed walking around the garden for about an hour.
However, I did not move for more than 30 minutes to get out of the parking lot, and the person parked in the back could not move at all.
It was a waste of time.
There is no person in charge, only cars near the entrance
Since it comes in from the side, the cars in the back that were lined up in the aisle from early on have no choice but to endure.
Should we organize the parking lot in the future?
The Hydrangea has also become crunchy.

hidekazu Tomoyasu,2022-06-12 09:34:49,4,22," I heard today.
It wasn't in full bloom, but it was a beautiful hydrangea.
There was no display of the line for worship and the line for goshuin, so everyone was in trouble because they didn't know what line they were lined up in. I was just lined up for a goshuin, so I called out several times to say that this example was a goshuin and the other side was a worship.
The route to the hydrangea garden after visiting the shrine is not displayed, so please write down the route for everyone you pass by! You said
The temple is really a splendid temple with a long history, but I think it's a shame that it has become a tourist spot.
If the admission fee is 1,000 yen, I would like you to handle and guide the worshipers properly.
As I wrote in other people's reviews, if it's a tourist spot, please place staff and guidance staff at the end of this place.

I was at a loss as to where to park my car.

The price was now 1,000 yen per car, but after waiting about 5 minutes, I was able to stop immediately. There are several places to park.

The entrance fee is 1,000 yen per person.

I wonder if about 70% of all the hydrangeas were blooming as a whole? The red hydrangea was also very impressive.

The hydrangea (in a small flowerpot) on the stairs was a little pitiful, but the hydrangea in the washbasin in the precincts was very nice ^ - ^
(* I'll post the image üíï)

This season ~ The best recommendation here is to go up the stairs and go to the washbasin.

However, I couldn't see the inside of the main hall, and I couldn't see the Buddha statue at all because the windows were reflecting and it was dark.

Some people lamented that they couldn't see the inside of the main hall even though they went on time online.
Even if there was time to spare, it seems that the principal image inside was not able to be seen.

If the staff of this temple had also politely told him about it, I think the grieving person would not have been hurt so much.

By the way, don't expect to answer the phone,
I think that the pamphlet has become more obsolete because it only adds a simple explanation to the ticket.

„Åü„Åë„Åª„Åå„Çâ,2022-07-26 10:28:42,4,4," It is about 40 minutes on foot from JR Uji Station. There is a parking lot in the temple, and it seems that there were many worshipers who came by car. My husband and I went on foot.

Mimurotoji's lotus garden is one of the most popular spots in Kyoto. When I went there, I found that there was no pond there, but lotus flowers were planted in pots and arranged side by side.

In Buddhism, the lotus is considered the most suitable flower for the Pure Land, as it stretches its stem out of unclean mud and blooms into a pure flower.

The lotus flower reminds me of a funeral altar. It is an image that is lit by a miniature light bulb, but the real thing is very beautiful. I took a picture and will upload it together.

There is also a large garden in the temple, and depending on the season, hydrangeas and azaleas bloom, which seems to be popular as well.

It was handled by two women, but was it very well handled? I was overwhelmed. Was it improved by ego search?

Lotuses are planted in front of the main hall, and you can enjoy collaboration with lotus flowers in July.

The entrance fee includes the price of plum candy, and you can get plum candy on the way back.
The parking lot is large and seems to be fixed at 1000 yen during the busy season, and people collect it without using the machine in the parking lot.
There are places where you can't pass each other on the road to the parking lot, and you can't see the other side, so it's a little difficult to pass each other.

I often visit for azaleas and hydrangeas, but I have never come for rhododendrons, so I thought I would visit once, and I visited because it was listed as the best time to see it on the homepage. The rhododendron flowers were as expected, and there was a weeping cherry tree near the teahouse, which I didn't expect. Personally, after climbing the azalea slope ahead, there is a bright red rhododendron in the back, but it would have been better if I could go see it now because it dries up considerably during the azalea season. thought.

Walking is walking, but in the azalea season, the weather was nice and I was able to walk comfortably. The azaleas weren't in full bloom because they bloomed and scattered depending on the amount of sunlight, but the wall-like azaleas were spectacular. If there are a lot of people, you may have a hard time going up and going back on the same road at the dead end, but fortunately it was not very popular on the first day of the azalea garden, so I enjoyed it.

Looking at other people's reviews, it seems to have improved a lot.
It is easy to imagine that the large precincts, hydrangea garden, etc. are beautifully maintained and costly. . .
The worship itself was beautiful in the fresh green, the warblers were singing, the wind was pleasant, and the view was good. However, the principal image of the main hall is not visible at all because the glass reflects.
The main hall is already closed when I take a short break to see the tower. The time is 15:38. .
