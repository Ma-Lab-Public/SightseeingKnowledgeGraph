The surrounding nature is really beautiful too. This place is well managed. However, you should come early in the morning otherwise it would be full of people.

Bruno Schwizer,2018-04-17 10:03:54,5,1,"Nice garden.  If coming this way, consider the ¬•600 daily bus pass which gives you unlimited bus rides for the day.  No trains pass this way to make the JR pass practical and if you try to walk it all, you'll probably run out of steam as there is a lot to do on this northeast side.  Bike might work as well but we didn't want to have to worry about constantly locking it up when we went inside somewhere.

Rob H,2018-04-20 14:24:29,5,6,"Absolutely stunning and beautiful.  This is a must see if you are in Kyoto.  I would highly highly recommend you book everything early if you are in the spring (Cherry Blossoms) or Fall (Two week period of color change) as the crowds will be MASSIVE and it will be very difficult to find a place to stay.  Spring and fall also present a large amount of tourists so there is a line to go through here.  Plan accordingly

Marie Weeks,2018-06-09 17:07:31,5,0,"This was my favorite place that we visited on our trip to Kyoto. I highly recommend going in the morning on a cloudy or lightly rainy day. The mist collects all around the gardens and gives it mystical glow. The gardens are absolutely beautiful! There's a  path the winds through the trees and leads up to an area with a nice view of the city nearby too. If you go in the rain, be very careful on the steps!

June Lee,2018-12-04 01:24:51,5,3,"Old temple which was built in 1482. The founder who was an admiral spent his whole life for his own architect. You‚Äôll have a spiritual experience of Japanese culture here where shows the beauty of seasonal change meets this temple in  a nature itself. This temple and the beautiful garden becomes part of a nature itself. Unlike a western style of garden which is full of flowers and trees  you will see a white sand presented like the waves of ocean and sand file looking like the shape of mountain Fuji. This is a very traditional style of Japanese garden. This is also very new to me who am used to looking  at a yard covered with green grass.  I wish I could make a visit to this temple in four different seasons to see the beauty of it.
The pamphlet says it‚Äôs the most beautiful garden in the whole world.

Hmmmm. I say maybe it‚Äôs the most beautiful one in Japan not in the world.

Alan Choi,2018-12-26 13:57:42,4,1,"It was too crowded to feel the zen but better than prohibiting outsiders. In Korean temples, anyone can enter the main shrine and enjoy the meditation but in Japanese, I could not see the Bhuda statue and such halls are closed or not allowed to enter. Probably there is another way to experience the temple stay but I hope to sit on the wood floor of the shrine. But the worry is, how about every tourist wants that?

Stacie,2019-08-23 17:40:42,5,0,"The best temple or shrine we went to in our two days in Kyoto! It wasn't jam packed with tourists and it was spread out so people didn't congregate in a few focal points. This place is certainly a photographer's dream as it is so well maintained with gorgeous views and greenery.

For the entry fee of I believe it was ¬•550 a person, it was a lot to see compared to other shrines and temples that charged similar prices but you either saw just one or two small shrines or other tourists got in the way and bumped into you constantly.

If you only have time to visit one temple or shrine, I suggest this one as it gives you a sense of real pride and care being put into the place while being able to enjoy some scenic nature away from noisy crowds.

Inside the temple, you'll be greeted by a scenic zen Japanese garden. You wouldn't find a real silver pavilion like how gold is in the Kinkaku-ji, however it is still amazing to see.

Gregory Howell,2021-01-13 04:06:27,5,0,"Over the past 40 years of living and traveling to and from Japan, the nation has become the second destination I call home. A visit to the ancient capital of Kyoto is a must for any traveler interested in history, culture, arts, cuisine, music and so much more. Kyoto refreshes the soul and  heightens awareness as you turn each and every corner. Ginkakuji or the Silver Pavilion is one of Japan's great treasures which lies at the end of a narrow pilgrimage pathway at the foot of the surrounding Kyoto mountains. Unlike its gilded 'cousin' Kinkakuji or Golden Pavilion,  Ginkakuji is modest, rustic and quiet. But when you pass through the long corridors of hedges and bamboo, you enter a beautiful paradise  complete with gardens, tea houses, temple buildings, mountain paths, and spectacular views of Kyoto. Spring Cherry Blossoms and Fall Foliage are of course the most popular, but I love Kyoto in winter when it is truly quiet to all the senses. Summer is extreme given the basin effect and the way heat is trapped by mountains on three sides of the city. But even in summer, the residents of Kyoto create wonderful ways to escape the heat and humidity, especially along the Kamogawa River and along other waterways throughout the ancient city. Don't forget to visit Omen for noodles, stroll the Philosopher's Walk, and learn about the magic of Japanese ceramics at the Robert Yellin Gallery which is just a few minutes walk from both Omen and the Philosophers Walk.

Jane Calextro,2021-10-30 21:50:55,5,6,"For the first time, I had a one day trip in Kyoto. At first, I was thinking of removing Ginkakuji in my itinerary because I was going to Kinkakuji anyway, but because of good reviews, I‚Äôve ended up going.

The nearest bus station was Ginkakujimichi Bus stop. The entrance fee was 500 yen. The landscape design of the place was amazing! I‚Äôve went to Kiyomizudera and Kinkakuji (every place has different vibe) but this was my favorite. If you like Japanese gardens, you should come here!

Shingo Sae-Lim,2021-12-02 09:02:33,4,1,"(Trip was made back then on 2 Dec 2019, 2 years before the Covid-19 Pandemic hit)

Due to he rainy weather, we had a change of plans and ended up visiting Ginkakuji instead.

The temple was initially supposed to be covered with silver leaf, in emulation of the gold-leaf covered Kinkakuji. However, it never came to fruition due to disruptions from the zoning war.

Even though Ginkakuji isn‚Äôt as extravagant or lavishly adorned like it‚Äôs golden counterpart, it‚Äôs subdued exterior emanate a subtle charm.

Personally, I prefer Ginkakuji as it feels more intimate as you can get up close and personal by wandering within its beautifully landscaped compound, which has a beautiful Japanese garden and a dry sand garden.

There were some autumn trees in the compound but most of them have already shed their leaves and were bare from the onset of winter. It would probably be a more amazing sight during the peak autumn season when the  foliage are more lush and vibrant.

It‚Äôs probably one of the most popular sites to visit aside from Kinkaku-ji and Fushimi Inari Shrine. It was very touristy even though it was raining, with people spewing in in droves.

Definitely take a peak at the tea spring well. It's so small, trickling away in the trees, but it's been constant for centuries and is the reason for so, so much!

The Zen temple is famous for its stunning gardens, which are beautifully landscaped with moss, stones, and various species of trees and plants. It's completely opposite to what we're used to in terms of lawn management where we remove moss but I can now see how beautiful moss cover can be with good management.

The temple's main building features a simple yet elegant design with a silver-colored roof that is not actually made of silver. The highlight for me was the scenic highlight up the hill which offers beautiful views of Kyoto and also the sand mounds shaped like Mount Fuji. The tranquil atmosphere and scenic views make this temple a peaceful escape for anyone visiting. Overall, Higashiyama Jisho-ji is a highly recommended attraction in Kyoto.

You feel to be in the middle of green and peace.

Ren√© Ratschiller,2023-04-30 08:50:27,5,1,"Beautiful place to take in some of Kyoto's history. A visit to the ""silver pavilion"" sets you back 500¬• per person and will take you around 45 minutes. You can not enter any building, but that doesn't take away from the experience. The temple and its buildings are surrounded by beautiful nature.

Max Pietsch (Max),2023-05-14 13:09:48,5,0,"We were the first people here when they opened so that improved our experience. It was very beautiful here. It was fascinating to see how Buddhists use nature as part of their spiritual practice here.

We left and had a wonderful time walking down the Philosopher's Path, and viewing some other temples which weren't crowded and were also beautiful and interesting in their own way.",no,,view review

Shreyamsa Manjunath,2023-05-18 12:43:24,5,0,"Not as eye-pleasing as its golden counterpart (the famous Kinkaku-ji), but it is a classy representation of the famed Japanese wabi sabi! A very well curated garden with magnificently articulate dry gardens are definitely worth one's time and money! And to top it, there is a viewpoint which offers some pretty sights of Kyoto, with Kinkaku-ji at the foreground. Definitely, one of the must-visits in Kyoto.

Marita,2023-05-21 14:00:27,5,1,"Perhaps the most beautiful place I have ever been to. Even in Kyoto, full of beauty, this is something extraordinary. Maybe it was the ceremony held inside the temple that created the very special, touching atmosphere.

Eugene M,2023-05-29 06:19:51,5,0,"Calm, serene, and beautiful. These are the only words that can describe the atmosphere in the Silver Pavilion. Compared to the Golden Pavilion it is rather uncrowded and cozier. A must see.

Sander van Vliet,2023-06-02 22:16:49,4,2,"Beautiful garden. It started a bit disappointing with a plain area full of stones and a small hill, but finally you had a nice walking route with good views and colorful plants. The rock, water and tree combination is perfect with the mossy bottom. On a clear day you have nice reflections in the water too. It takes approximately 30 minutes maximum to go around. There is a designated walking route to stick to.

Would recommend going back to the start after reaching the top and the re-entering and feeling for yourself how your focus of the landscape changes. Also def life goals to have such a based cottage that it becomes a national treasure and global heritage site.,no,,view review
