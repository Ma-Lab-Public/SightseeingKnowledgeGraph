The bamboo forest is quite incredible, although very busy. Would advise going very early if you want to get any good photos without lots of other people.

The monkey park is a fair hike up the hill but worth it. You can feed them and they're everywhere.

There was also a garden park area; very pretty and the ticket included a green matcha tea which was very nice.
