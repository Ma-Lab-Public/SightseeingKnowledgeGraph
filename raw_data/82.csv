There's nothing part of the garden area (more a small park) which I recognised as such. Might be part of the temple, then, but by the time I'd finished the garden that was closed (4:30).

Heiko Sendrowski,2018-10-26 15:44:09,1,2,"This is my first negative post, and I have to say that Daigo-ji has deserved it. I cannot recommend visiting this place before 2040:

-1) The entrance fee is a total ripoff. It is 1500 yen in any decent season other than in the middle of winter or summer. The fee covers two temples plus one museum, and you probably are willing to pay for World Heritage status. But the fee does not include all temples of the complex (Kami-Daigo up the mountain is not covered and costs another 400 yen), and the ones included are hardly worth 500 yen each.

-2) The ""garan"" section comprises the admittedly beautiful Benten-do. Just check the pictures of a small vermilion/white ""one-storey-pagoda"" at the end of a vermilion wooden bridge over a streamlet entering a pond. Really nice. And small. The whole area of pond, pagoda, bridge, waterfall and all is approximately 100 x 50 m (ca. 330x190 feet), including the on-site restaurant. If you want to see a nice garden in Yamashina, consider visiting Bishamon-do Monzeki at the northern border of this ward.

-3) The calligrapher at Denpoin Daikodo, the temple building next downhill form Benten-do in the ""garan"" section, is inept. Sorry to say that, but I would really like to rip the page out of my goshuinchou.

-4) The ""garan"" section also comprises the Goju-no-to, a five storey pagoda. This pagoda is really old but in good shape. It is located at the eastern (hillward) end of an open square of some 30 x 30 m (approx. 130x130 feet) covered in gravel with the general appeal of a makeshift car park. In case you are a student of city planning or architecture please visit the site and learn for good how a building can be debased by its surroundings. If you are not such a student, go to Nara and enjoy the pagodas there.

-5) All other buildings in ""garan"" section are either beautifully old but tainted by their parking lot settings, or are dilapidated/severely damaged by the taifuns of 2018 latest. At any rate, other sites offer quite similar buildings, maybe not of the same age, but without the inconvenience of traveling to this somewhat remote spot.

-6) The taifuns of 2018 have erased the former forest at the entrance of the ""garan"" section. While the taifuns are hardly the fault of the site management, not adjusting the entrance fee according to the ensuing aesthetic devaluation is. Thus, should you come here before 2040 do not expect to be greeted by any appearances of solemnity. I do hope that measures are taken to remedy the deforestation.

-7) Niomon, the gate at the entrance of the ""garan"" section, is a good sight, but so are others elsewhere. And it can be seen without entrance fee from the main avenue.

+1) Sanpo-in. No regrets regarding this temple other than that its entrance fee is used to subsidize the other temple complex parts.

Tl;dr: If you want to see a good garden and fusuma paintings at a tripled entrance fee, come here and visit Sanpo-in. You may then also pay a courtesy visit to Daigo-in's other sections.

Senkan Koukuu,2019-08-18 04:22:12,5,5,"A good tourist site. The three tourist points seem to be the large pagoda, a small garden inside one of the temple buildings, and the artifacts stored in one of the facilities. To be truthful, the artifacts are just scrolls you cannot read(and no, not because you are a foreigner but because the Kanji are written in an ancient, cursive fashion...), but the pagoda and the garden are quite very pretty. I liked the garden really much and it was truly breathtaking as it rained heavily- imagine rain splashing over a beautifully constructed garden, bubbling its waters and soothing its trees! - but regrettably you are not allowed to take pictures of it and there are at least 3 staff workers on guard constantly. I am not one to challenge rules so I just gazed at the rain from the temple aisle for about 10 minutes.

Overall, the temple is totally worth a visit and the 800 yens' admission fee. Not just the three places but the intricate structure of the buildings, the tea room, the walk, the ponds... the 'artificial nature' surrounding each temple building and the Buddhas... everything is fascinating, yet somewhat subtly different from Buddhist temples of different cultures.

This shrine and temple complex is one of the oldes in Kyoto. Burn and reconstructed many times along the centuries. The 5 stores Pagoda is the oldest known building in all Kyoto dating back to the year 900. The serene and relaxing pathways are made to meditate and find yourself.

Unfortunately, it cost way too much for a ticket, combined with the fact that it is so far away from Kyoto city centre, no wonder why not many people come. The complexity of Japanese public transportation doesn‚Äôt help either.
Also, the museum is nothing short of a disappointment.

There many of beautiful paintings of the wall the inside of the temple.
