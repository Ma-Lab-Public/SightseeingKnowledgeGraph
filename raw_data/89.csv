First of all, you will be overwhelmed by the amount of roasting sold on the approach and everywhere in the precincts. The hoboku, which is dedicated with the wishes of good men and women, is broken at Mibu Kyogen's 'hobokuwari' in April and October. Mibu Kyogen is an important intangible folk cultural asset, and ""Setsubun"" is performed on Setsubun. I stood in line for an hour to watch it, but the person sitting next to me had come from Tokyo to watch this.
Yamabushi kneading memorial service is also worth seeing. After the dialogue between Benkei and Togashi in the kabuki kanjincho, the yamabushi actually shoots an arrow. It's quite thrilling to jump over a large crowd and fly an arrow to the roof. After that, the Ogoma prayer is held, and the precincts are enveloped in smoke and ash. Ashes will fall on your clothes, so it is better not to wear important clothes.
Of course, you can also see the historic sites of the Shinsengumi, so you can spend quite a long time.

There is also a paid nursing home and kindergarten in the precincts, and there is a viewing seat on the second floor of the kindergarten building, and Mibu Kyogen performed in the building across from there is appreciated, so people who can see it must be lucky. Mibu-dera is also famous as a garrison for the Shinsengumi. Many young women worshipers also came. From this area to the Fushimi magistrate's office, there are still many places related to the soldiers, so it's good to walk around and visit them.

Because history is distorted from the point of view of the victors, the evaluation of the Shinsengumi, which fiercely fought against the Yusin forces at the time, is negative. There are some assumptions in history, but. If the shogunate was extended even after the Yusin forces were defeated and the shogunate forces won at that time, I imagine that there would not have been an invasion of a neighboring country by Jeonghanron.

Naka Hiro,2022-08-07 01:36:15,5,6," In recent years, this temple has gained a high level of recognition due to its association with the Shinsengumi, but its foundation dates back to the 10th century. There are many events with a long history, such as the Setsubun Festival in February, which is 900 years old, and Mibu Kyogen in spring and autumn, which is 700 years old. Compared to that, the Shinsengumi of at most 150 years ago is just a newcomer.
Because it is a temple in Rakuchu, it has been destroyed by fire many times and almost nothing remains of the old hall. On the day I visited, preparations were just being made for the Urabon festival (this event also has a history of 850 years).
By the way, Mibu, which includes this Mibu Temple, is an area where the old-fashioned lifestyle of common people remains strong even in Kyoto. It's an area that has little to do with tourism, but if you have the chance to visit here, I hope you can feel the weight of the existence of this temple, which is rooted not only in the Shinsengumi but also in the local faith.

„Å®„ÇÇ„Åì,2022-10-16 01:49:56,5,18," During the consecutive holidays in October, I went to Mibu-dera Temple, which is said to be associated with the Mibu Kyogen and the Shinsengumi. The entrance fee for the temple is 300 yen, and you can see not only the precincts but also the historical materials room in the basement.

Also, since it was during the autumn special exhibition period of [Mibu Kyogen], I also saw [Mibu Kyogen], which has a history of 700 years since the Kamakura period. The viewing fee is 1,000 yen for adults. There are three performances a day, and each performance lasts about 45 minutes, which is quite long.

Mibu Kyogen is a silent drama that wears masks and only gestures, and is characterized by the unique movements of the masked performers to the sounds of gongs, drums, and flutes. Since this was my first time seeing it, I bought a commentary booklet edited and published by Mibu Dainenbutsu-ko, and witnessed representative performances of Mibu Kyogen, such as Tsuchigumo and Dojoji, right in front of my eyes. I managed to understand the content of the silent play that was unfolding ^ ^

The Kyogen performers are also members of the Mibu Dai-Nenbutsu-ko, and they are not full-time employees, but full-time office workers or self-employed people. And.
Also, I learned from this booklet that everyone except the person in charge of dressing the costumes is male.
Thanks to these people, Mibu Kyogen has been passed down to this day.

There are 30 pieces currently being performed. This time, I have only seen three performances, so I hope I can see it on another occasion.

When I visit this temple, I always buy flowers, incense sticks, and candles from Mizukake Jizo at the shop. After visiting, the pond behind Mizukake Jizo is decorated with a golden dragon. It is not lit up, so it looks more beautiful during bright hours than at night. The dragon reflected on the surface of the water seems to rise in the blue sky and is very fantastic. Cherry trees are planted around the pond, so it looks more fantastic in the spring, and it seems that the mind is purified. If you are interested in this post, please visit once. Recommended!
