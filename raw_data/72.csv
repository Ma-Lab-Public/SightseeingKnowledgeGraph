Good for the value though.
The building is beautiful but not the stage and lights.
You can take free pictures at the end of the 50 min presentation with some maikos.

Luke Phang,2017-04-10 12:22:22,3,0,"We wanted to go to Gion Corner specifically to catch their geisha shows. While we did spot a few geisha on the streets, the performance was not what we had in mind. Cultural, yes, but value wise, not really. The tickets cost around 25 USD and featured different performances that is supposed to capture the Japanese culture. It's informative and eye-opening, but it was something that I cannot appreciate, sadly. There was one segment where the people were purposely singing off tune and because the show is in Japanese, we didn't understand the dialogue either. But if you want to see how Japanese traditional performances are like, you should check this out.

Andreea C,2017-07-13 02:09:55,5,2,"This easy introduction into Japanese artistic expression was the perfect pre dinner entertainment. For a reasonable price ( 2500 yen) you get one hour of dancing, music and theatre with added bonus of seeing a tea ceremony and some live ikebana. The wait for tickets is not long, but being there early ( the ticket booth opens  at 17.30 for same day shows) gives you a better seat as it's first come, first serve.

Faye Guidry,2017-07-19 12:06:39,4,1,"Great performances. A good intro to various Japanese arts. It goes fast at times so pay attention! Also, it seems it is very popular with foreign tourists, so if you're looking for a quiet and respectful audience to watch a show with you, you'd better find a more exclusive performance. The row behind us laughed inappropriately, and talked during nearly all of the performances. I felt bad for the performers and musicians who obviously put a lot of time into practicing for their shows.

Russell Miln,2017-07-20 12:32:19,2,1,"Reminds me why cultural rarely means entertaining.  Lack of tiers makes it hard to see.

Besides from architecture, the Geishas mighr be the only reason to come here,and they are rare and a bit unfortunate to have so many tourists coming running after them to take photos...

The show is simple and felt more like a “tourist trap” for the price and quality of entertainment.  We were curious to learn about Japanese performance art so we thought to check it out.

Stephanie C,2017-11-22 21:30:14,3,0,"All in all, it’s not so bad for someone who’s not very familiar with Japanese culture outside of anime. But if you are, you might want to find something elsewhere.

Positives: This affordable show is great for those wanting a taste of Japanese entertainment without prior knowledge. It’s welcoming to foreigners and doesn’t feel exclusive or snooty, and it’s in a digestible serving of only 50 minutes.

Negatives: Unfortunately the price you pay for that is a bit steep for anyone who doesn’t normally do tourist traps. They sell too many tickets so people have to stand in the back. There are about 5 different art forms presented during this time with English narration that provides the history of the art, but not the story of the performance (you have to read in the pamphlet for that—when you’re tired from a long day of exploring Kyoto you don’t want to read).

Carol A,2018-07-24 00:03:44,3,1,"We watched the entire show and honestly I was quite bored unfortunately. I don't think the tea ceremony works well in this type of scenario as not many people can see so everyone just talks and looks at their phone, children scream and fidget constantly also. The Geisha dances were good but the rest I didn't really see the point. I think flower arranging and tea ceremony are not a thing that a whole audience can appreciate, I think it would be best individually or in a classroom environment.

Don't worry about language barriers, as there was a translator on site who informed the audience as to what was taking place.

It was a personal hell. My love for my wife, respect for the rules and the performers kept me in my seat the whole insane time. This was a test of patience that made the show impossible to enjoy.

From the start, we were treated to the greatest hits of bad manners. People were still talking during the introduction in Japanese, and didn't even stop when they did the English.

- Talking and joking loudly during all performances
- People showing up late and leaving early. Very disruptive.
- Half the room holding up their phones to film blocking others view. some people even standing.
- One woman, glued to her phone playing candy crush and listening to music.
- And the coup de grace, during the bunraku puppet show they turn all the lights off. A man moves closer, turns on the bright flash of his phone and video records the whole thing. Totally ruined the show for everyone.

Marjorie Ann Co,2019-12-31 08:11:06,5,1,"We tested luck when we went to Gion district that day. We were lucky to see two geishas. I guess if you wish to see them, you need to watch an exhibition.

I loved the feel of air in this area. You could really feel the culture, tradition, and art, preserved in this place. Next time maybe we'll try to book an exhibition.

Kuber Sodari,2020-01-01 03:23:40,5,0,The street was full of visitors and they have very cute shops on the side ways. There are some food shops as well so we can experience those as well. This street is mostly crowded around evening time. They have historical artifacts and gifts on the shop sideways.,no,,view review

little dot,2020-01-31 11:44:10,5,1,"Old Street for geisha sightings but it was a rainy day so there was none, probably better in the evening. This street is at the busiest shopping area with a lot of cafes, restaurants, many matcha soft ice cream shops (u must eat a few). There is a kanji museum that we went to see. There were plums blossoming in the parks as it is winter season.

gradhito,2020-09-16 08:43:40,4,6,"Hanamikoji-dori seems to be the go-to spot when tourist visits Gion. You'll find lots of foreigners here wearing traditional Japanese kimono. They all don't come here without a reason, as the street is pleasantly wonderful to stroll around, whether day/night. If you're lucky you'll spot a Maiko on her way. Authentic Japanese restaurants and cafes on your left and right will surely gives you a unique experience. Most of them comes with a high priced menu here.

Jason Camorlinga,2022-11-24 01:01:28,3,1,"This place is usually so crowded that it is not a great use of your time. However, directly after Japan reopened it was remarkable pleasant to walk around. There are many similar streets around Japan which are not nearly as impacted by tourists and judging by all the signage, the locals struggle with the crowds on a daily basis.
