When going from Landian Arashiyama Station, you have to cross the Togetsukyo Bridge first and then climb a short flight of stairs. Arriving, the temple enshrines Kukongzang Bodhisattva. It is said that Bodhisattva can fulfill the wishes of believers. It is said that if you look back at Falun Temple when crossing the Togetsukyo Bridge after visiting, the wish you made with Bodhisattva will be recalled and disappeared. Quite an interesting local legend. This trip is because Falun Temple has special openings and activities at night in conjunction with the annual Arashiyama Lantern Road, so I have the opportunity to know this temple. The special event of the Lantern Road is to light up the main hall of Falun Temple, using various colors The lighting effect is like a light show, which is a very rare experience and visual enjoyment. In addition, the platform next to the temple can have a panoramic view of the entire Arashiyama area, and you can also overlook the Kyoto Tower.

When everyone comes to Arashiyama, they concentrate on the north side of the river, that is, the area around Tenryu-ji Temple.
When he turns 13, he visits to receive wisdom, saying <Jusan Mairi>.
What's interesting is that after visiting the shrine, you cross the Togetsukyo Bridge toward Kawakita, but if you turn around until you've finished crossing, you'll return the wisdom you've been given, so your parents and siblings will deliberately shout from behind to make you turn around. Hang it. ‚ÄúCute „Äá„Äá-chan, look this way! What is it that trains the strength of the will not to look back?

This is a long introduction, but please bring your children along.

There is a traditional event called Jusan Mairi, which has been passed down in Kyoto since ancient times. For one month before and after April 13th, when children turn 13, they visit Horinji Temple in Arashiyama to receive wisdom and good fortune.

The principal object of worship is Gokukuzo Bosatsu, a Buddha known as Kokuzo who controls wisdom. For people in Kyoto, this place seems to be special. (meaning one step higher than Jusan Mairi at other temples)

Why is it this time of year? Recently, there is also the autumn 13 visit, which is also held from October to November. I was waiting for about 3 pairs with my parents today.

There are things you cannot do after visiting the main shrine. Patience until Togetsukyo Bridge, a serious face, clenched teeth and hurry home. The 13th visit to the temple will teach you that.

Another is the torii gate of Dendengu. A shrine that prays for the development of all electricity-related businesses and for no accidents. You can see the names of companies from home appliance manufacturers to construction companies and broadcasting companies.

There is Denden Shrine in the temple, and I also visited here. From the terrace-like parking lot, you can see Togetsukyo in the distance.

Yoshinori kageshima,2022-09-28 23:42:39,5,3," A temple of the Shingon sect of Buddhism, located in the mountains of Arashiyama, Kyoto, where Kokuzo Bosatsu is enshrined as the principal image of worship.
Commonly known as ""Saga no Kokuzo-sama""
According to the temple legend, it was founded in the 6th year of Wado and later changed its name to Horinji after enshrining a statue of Kokuzo Bosatsu!
The principal image Kokuzo Bosatsu is known as the guardian deity for those born in the year of the ox and the year of the tiger.
It seems that the needle memorial service and the 13th visit are famous events.
Jusan-mairi was originally held on March 13 of the lunar calendar.
It is called ""Chie-mairi"", and 13-year-old men and women make a pilgrimage to receive wisdom and good fortune. It seems that there is a message.
In the precincts of Horinji Temple, there is a shrine called Dendengu, which enshrines Denden Myojin, the guardian deity of electricity and radio waves.
Is it about a 5-minute walk from Hankyu Arashiyama Station or Randen Arashiyama Station?

Ê©ãÂè£ÈõÖÂ≠ê,2022-10-22 06:05:10,5,5," It is convenient from Hankyu Arashiyama Station. It's a little hard to find without crossing the Togetsukyo Bridge, but there aren't many people because it's a little-known spot. If you slowly climb the stone steps surrounded by deep greenery, you can see the splendid main hall, the stage, Togetsukyo Bridge, and the mountains of Arashiyama in the distance. I think the autumn leaves üçÅ will be splendid as autumn progresses.

Dendengu Shrine, which is dedicated to the guardian deity of electricity and radio waves, is known to be visited by many people, including those involved in television. Therefore, you can ask for rare charms such as charms to be attached to smartphones and PCs, and SD cards. By the way, the omikuji is 100 yen.

Away from the crowds of Arashiyama, the scenery from the stage is nice, so I think it's a good place to stop by.

When I crossed the Togetsukyo Bridge on my way home, I remember my mother saying to me, ""Don't look back.""
When I visited again today, I thought that I had climbed the stone steps wearing a kimono to a temple on such a high mountain.
In the precincts, there is ""Dendengu"" where the god of electric waves is enshrined.
In addition, if you go through the gate on the right side of the main hall, there is a stage with a good view of Kyoto. There is also a bench, perfect for a short break.

It's just a bonus, and I'm going to give you a microSD amulet.

Training mode specification that double-sided tape comes with the media side when removed from the mount.

While thinking that my faith will be tested, I peeled it off carefully and used it while muttering ""thank you, thank you..."" in my heart.

There's a nice image inside, and there's no way I can format it by mistake, so what should I do...

In the spring season, the scenery overlooking the city of Kyoto surrounded by cherry blossoms is spectacular. I think that it is good to visit for the purpose of taking a walk.

There is Arashiyama Togetsukyo Bridge in the immediate vicinity, so you can do sightseeing in this area alone for a day.

Ëàû„ÅÆÂÆÆ,2023-05-04 06:33:26,5,0," ‚óèThe place where I made my 13th visit. This year, my child also visited 13 visits here.
‚óèAs for his age, he is 13 years old. A child who graduates from elementary school and advances to junior high school is preferable. However, now, regardless of age, if you are born prematurely between the ages of 11 and 13, there is no problem.
‚óèI think that many people from Kyoto visit this temple.
‚óèThe price varies depending on how many days you wish to pray, but as a guideline, it starts from 5,000 yen per week.
‚óèThe person receiving the prayer should come up with a favorite kanji character.
‚óèClothing seems to be various. Some people dress up, but the suit and dress used at the graduation ceremony, the junior high school uniform, and the clothes for going out. It's good if you have a feeling! ! !
‚óèBecause my legs get numb when sitting in the seiza position, is it a folk remedy to relieve the numbness in my legs when I sit with my big toes on top of each other? For reference...
‚óèAs an aside, there is a legend that children who come to visit the 13th shrine should not look back until they have crossed the Togetsukyo Bridge. Please try it on your way home.

Thank you very much for giving my son wisdom.

Both brothers and sisters visited each other with Jusanmairi.
After the memorial service, I feel that my face has tightened and changed.

I am grateful that I was able to visit the temple safely with my child, just like my parents took me, while feeling awe for the customs of the 13th mairi, a tradition that has been handed down from ancient times as a circle of the twelve signs of the zodiac.
