yuki yoroshi,2019-03-05 01:12:27,5,4," A temple of the Rinzai sect in Sagano, Kyoto.
This temple, which has a reputation for the beauty of autumn leaves, has been introduced many times in media such as TV, magazines, and books. Pictures of gardens are often used in jigsaw puzzles and calendars. In addition, even outside the fall foliage season, seasonal flowers bloom and you can enjoy the tasteful garden.
Hokyo-in Temple was built during the Heian period as an imperial temple of Emperor Shirakawa (1053-1129). Chokuganji refers to temples built by imperial decree to protect the nation and provide peace of the body, such as Todaiji, Daianji, and Yakushiji.

Hokyo-in was not called 'Hokyo-in' from the time it was built, but was originally called 'Zenyu-ji.' From the end of the Heian period to the Kamakura period, several generations of members of the imperial family entered the temple and became chief priests.

During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (1345-1350), Mokuan Shuyu Zenji, a high-ranking disciple of Muso Kokushi, joined the temple and restored the declining temple. At this Zennyu-ji Temple, he actively educated his disciples, and since then it has become a temple of the Rinzai sect.

Yoshiakira Ashikaga, the second shogun of the Muromachi Shogunate, lost his mother in 1365. At the memorial service, he listened to a lecture on the scriptures from Mokuan, and after participating in Zen meditation, he converted to Mokuan. Then, for his teacher's sake, he devoted himself to the maintenance of the monastery of Zennyu-ji Temple.

At that time, the main gate, temple gate, and Buddhist hall were built in a straight line from east to west. rice field. The location of the temple has not changed from its current location according to the ""Oei Kyunmeizu"" (a layout map of temples in the Saga area in the early Muromachi period).

In 1367, Yoshiakira died at the age of 38, and Zennyu-ji Temple became his family temple. In the era of Yoshimasa, the eighth shogun, the name of the temple was changed to Hokyo-in, after Yoshiakira's name, Hokyo-in. There were temple territories in Bitchu and Suo, and the temples were also prosperous thanks to the protection of successive generations of the Ashikaga shogunate. However, after the Onin War, temples declined along with the decline of the shogunate. This is because the temple estate was also embezzled, and it became economically difficult.

During the Edo period, Hokyo-in became a sub-temple of Tenryu-ji Temple, and the gate was located facing south, unlike today.
The temple was abandoned at the end of the Edo period, but was rebuilt after fifty years.

Mokuan became acquainted with Kusunoki Masatsura, a military commander of the Southern Court in Kawachi Province, and entrusted him with his affairs.

In the first month of 1348 (1348), Masayuki fought against a large army of the Northern Court led by Moronao Ko at the Battle of Shijonawate and died (at the age of 23). rice field. Later, when Yoshiakira heard this story from Mokuan, he praised Masayuki's character and asked him to be buried next to him.

In 1891 (Meiji 24), the governor of Kyoto, Kunimichi Kitagaki, regretted that the ruins of Konan (Masatsuyuki Kusunoki) were buried in secret, and in order to inform the world about this, he created a stone monument ""Kinchuhi"", which describes the origin of the burial mound for heads. ‚Äô was built.

In order to protect the ruins related to Kusunoki Masayuki, Hokyo-in Temple was rebuilt as a temple to mourn for Kusunoki Masayuki's soul, by Takagi Ryuen Tenryu-ji Temple head chief and Kobe businessman Yoshitaro Kawasaki.

The old precincts were repurchased, and the temple was refurbished by building new buildings and relocating old buildings.

The construction was completed in 1916, and the wooden standing statue of the eleven-faced, thousand-armed Kanzeon Bodhisattva (left photo) was welcomed as the principal object of worship. After that, the tea room was relocated and the current main hall was newly built.

It is no exaggeration to say that there is nothing that can beat this one in terms of beauty among the many Karesansui gardens. I can only sigh.
It is also known for the grave of Masatsura Kusunoki's child, Masatsura.

The autumn leaves were coming to an end on this day, and I was planning to look around Sagano. I thought that if it wasn't first thing in the morning, there would be too many people, and I would end up looking at the people rather than the scenery, so I made it my first stop. About 10 people in line at 8:50... it's still okay.
Gates open at 9:00. If you enter from the back door on the right, the guide will guide you to the ticket vending machine. Buy a ticket and go inside from the entrance on the right.

Thanks to that, I was able to see the beautiful autumn leaves close to the fallen leaves.
I think it's a little-known spot with a calm atmosphere.
The history is deep and intriguing.

I am very sorry that the attitude of the person at the reception was unfriendly and uncomfortable.

ak,2022-03-19 00:16:25,5,3," This historical temple was built in Sagano by Emperor Shirakawa during the Heian period. Located behind Seiryo-ji Temple, it is a relatively small temple, but the autumn leaves in the garden are wonderful.
When I passed through the gate, I was overwhelmed by the cobblestone pavement and the tunnel of autumn leaves. The gradation of autumn leaves dyed in red, yellow, and orange is beautiful. Green moss is planted vividly around the stone pavement.
The temple is famous for its beautiful autumn leaves in Sagano, so the autumn leaves season is not as crowded as around Arashiyama.

Located on the road between Daikaku-ji and Gio-ji, admission fee is 500 yen, worship hours are 9:00 to 16:00, tripods and large cameras are prohibited (details are written on the website, so check it if you want to take pictures without a smartphone) is more certain)
It's crowded, but if it's not something like ""I want to shoot a landscape with no one in it!""
Many people take pictures from the stone-paved garden path and the main hall, but this area is crowded, so let's take a quick photo and leave.
It's compactly organized, and I think I can see the falling maple leaves as long as the wind doesn't blow too hard, so I can safely recommend it to other people.

Boyu Chen,2023-01-07 05:02:11,5,0," I visited at the end of November, and I was not in the itinerary, but I saw that the maple leaf condition of Baokuangyuan was good that day. It is not too far from Lanshan Street, so I stopped by to have a look. The conclusion is that the trip is worthwhile!
The temple is not too big, but compared with other scenic spots in Arashiyama, it is less well-known and there are not so many people, so it will not be so crowded. Walking into the temple is like stepping into the red world. The yellow, yellow, red and red lines are very beautiful. , You can take off your shoes to pay homage to the temple. After the visit, sit on the tatami mats and enjoy the Japanese-style garden scenery outside the door. However, you can‚Äôt sit for too long to avoid hindering others from taking pictures. The 500 yuan ticket feels great value for money! If you come to Arashiyama, you might as well take a look here!

""Open the door over there and come in."" The moment I opened the door, a voice leaked out! What a wonderful snowscape!

When I went to the main hall, one of the first young women was taking pictures. Since the seat was vacated, I put my hands on the principal image first. Young and beautiful, I called out to her on my way home.
‚ÄúDid you come for the snow scene?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, the autumn leaves are also very beautiful.‚Äù The drooping cherry blossoms‚Ä¶ the corridors around here are full of people.‚Äù
""Also, the garden in front of me can't be seen because of the dry landscape and snow..."" ""Hey, I can see the road over there.""

He told me that he has been here many times, and he kindly told me to open the shoji screen and take good pictures. Thanks to that, the circuit garden where I stepped on the fresh snow, the sneakers got snowy, wet and cold!üòÇ

YUNCHING YANG,2023-04-10 17:05:19,3,1," An application is required for taking pictures with a large monocular, and there is no limit for mirrorless small monoculars, decimal digits or mobile phones. The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe courtyard is small, and there are not many passages, so it is easy to photograph passers-by. Those who want to take good photos have to think twice. There are pass tickets for Baoyanyuan and Baohangyuan. If you can visit both places, you can buy a pass to save money. However, the notice of Baohangyuan is not obvious
