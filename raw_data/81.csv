We bought our ticket in the Kansai Tourist Information Center and got discount price (¥600 from ¥770), and it was worth it. You can easily locate famous spots in Kyoto with their free binnocular. We went on a sunny day and got to see Osaka as well.

Paradise Walker,2017-02-04 10:25:00,5,1,"Kyoto Tower is not so tall  but has enough height to see many of the buildings in Kyoto.  My recommendation is to visit this Kyoto Tower after your sightseeing in Kyoto.   It can be fun to find out the buildings you visited from the tower.  Around sunset time can be the best time to go up to the tower.   You can enjoy both day and night views!

Benedict Uy,2017-02-14 06:31:03,4,0,"We came by just before it was closing. Since we had come from Tokyo and seen the night skyline from the skytree, the skyline of Kyoto wasn't as impressive. It was quite different seeing the orange cage around the observation deck.
What I did notice was that there were plenty of blacked out regions around the city, presumably the myriad of temples around the area. I would guess that the views during the day would be more interesting with the many temples visible from the deck.
We thought we saw the pagoda from Kiyomizudera since it was lit up. The interactive board was useful in trying to identify the places around the area.

Liz K.,2017-05-06 19:00:44,5,2,"A rainy day in Kyoto and this was perfect. A great view of the city and perfect to get your bearings before you set off to explore. The info-touchscreens at the top of the tower allow you to know what you're looking at, really nice way to get an overview of Kyoto. We also ate here - not at the top floor, but they have many different restaurants in a cafeteria-style kind of area on one of the lower floors. There's a bar at one of the higher floors that didn't look too expensive (and might be a good option to be up in the tower without paying for the observation deck, if you're not into that).

Teddy Grenman,2017-07-05 02:15:16,4,1,"Excellent view of Kyoto, binoculars are free to use and one can see multiple interesting sights (which you should visit later on), buildings, and even catch a glimpse of those Japanese bullet trains.

Unfortunately, however, most city skyline views are very similar.

Location is good, easily accessible. Visit if not very budget constrained. At the time Adults approximately ¥700 and lower for children.

It gives you a complete 360° view of the city, with free stand-alone binoculars, as well as free handheld ones too for looking at specific areas. There are also screens placed at regular intervals around the observatory deck which tells you exactly where key locations to view are.
I recommend this if you like the views and are interested in learning more about the surrounding area, I would happily go back again, a lovely experience!

It's not a particularly high tower compared to others in Japan, but since all of the other buildings in Kyoto are short, you can see plenty of the other attractions in the city.

Lindo Korchi,2018-08-11 03:01:01,5,0,"In one of the lower floors in Kyoto Tower, you’ll see a place dedicated to selling Japanese sweets, many of which are specific to Kyoto. Such as Yatsuhashi in a variety of flavors (strawberry, lemon, and even chocolate).

There are also these packs of small, bite sized chocolate cookies that come in two flavors. One is mattcha (green tea), and the other is regular, I believe. There’s also a yatsuhashi that is sold which is full of chocolate — including the outer layer! Good place to get some sweets in Kyoto.

The red “cage bars” that make Kyoto tower unique has the disadvantage of impeding views and interferes with selfies and photos. Still, it’s worth a go but on the pricier side without discount.

Andy A.,2019-10-26 05:34:29,5,2,"Very scenic location. I went at night which was very beautiful, but it also limited the places I could see. I would say it's worth going at either time. There are high powered binoculars and the key points to search are marked on the tower glass. With a high powered zoom lens on a good camera you could capture some nice photos. I would hate to live near the tower with so many people able to look into my living room!

Price was fair at under $8 US for adults. You could maximize your time there and have a meal in the tower restaurant. Perhaps the best time is at sunset so you could see all of the landmarks and then watch the night view. There are small souvenirs and a stamp to keep a memento.

We wanted something fun and easy before dinner, and this did not disappoint. It took us less than an hour to get tickets to see the tower and return. It's great for little ones too. They had interactive screens that highlighted different Kyoto areas and gave information on each. The screen also provided a QR Code which brought you more information. They have several languages available, which makes navigating easy.
My one critique is the glass in the stair portion is a little worn and can be hard to see out of. That is not from lack of cleanliness. It is just older. This does not take much away from experience, but it does lower my score,

The 800-ton tower stands atop a 9-story building, which houses a 3-star hotel and several stores. The entire complex stands opposite Kyōto Station.Kyoto is Japan’s most elegant city, where its cultural traditions are best preserved. Here we expect to find wooden townhouses on lantern lit lanes, ancient shrines and temples, stately palaces and meditative gardens. So a first time visitor to Kyoto might well be surprised by the sight of the brightly painted red and white tower that stands directly across from Kyoto Station’s north central exit.A cheerful beacon of 1960’s optimism, Kyoto Tower stands at 131 meters high from its base to the tip of its spire, and it is the tallest structure in Kyoto. As such it dominates the skyline and can be spotted from many of the sightseeing locations around the city. For a little over 50 years this curious structure has split opinion between those who see it as a symbol of modern Kyoto, and others who see it as a tacky and inappropriate folly.

It's not worth to pay to go up to the observation platform since you can get the same view from many other places in the city. It's better appreciated from afar due to its heavy color contrast.

Located in the heart of the city, the tower offers panoramic views of Kyoto's famous temples and shrines, as well as the surrounding mountains and valleys. The tower is about 100 meters high, and on the top floor there is an observation deck from which you can enjoy a 360-degree view of Kyoto.
The tower has many other attractions including a cafe and a gift shop.
The Tower is easily accessible by public transport as it is close to several metro and bus stops. Parking is also available for guests arriving by car.
One of the best things about the Kyoto Tower is the observation deck, which offers amazing views of the city. The deck is ideal for taking photos of the city and a great place to watch the sunset.
All in all, the Kyoto Tower is a must-see for anyone visiting Kyoto. The combination of views, attractions and accessibility make it a great addition to any itinerary. I recommend visiting the Kyoto tower in the morning or evening to take advantage of the best lighting and avoid the crowds. 📷 🌅 ☀️ ❄️

There are electronic maps that provide reference points and description of places, which is nice.",no,,view review
John Pedersen,2023-04-01 09:14:25,4,0,"This is the shortest tower we have visited on our trip. At only 100 metres tall it's very short. But it was a great day and the views were spectacular. Cheap to get in and plenty of good views of Kyoto.

Make me a trip advisor review about Kyoto tower which we saw last March

I'd be happy to help you write a Trip Advisor review for the Kyoto Tower that you saw last March. Here's a sample review:

""I recently had the pleasure of visiting the Kyoto Tower during my trip to Japan last March, and I have to say, it was an incredible experience. From the moment I stepped inside, I was blown away by the stunning views of the city that stretched out before me. The panoramic views from the observation deck were truly breathtaking, and I found myself completely immersed in the beauty of Kyoto.

The tower itself is a modern marvel, with sleek architecture and impressive design. I was impressed by how well-maintained everything was, from the spotless windows to the comfortable seating areas. The staff were friendly and helpful, and I appreciated the informative displays that provided insight into the history and culture of Kyoto.

Overall, I highly recommend a visit to the Kyoto Tower for anyone traveling to Japan. Whether you're a first-time visitor or a seasoned traveler, the views and experiences offered by the tower are truly unforgettable. Don't miss out on this amazing opportunity to see Kyoto from a whole new perspective!""

We did not go inside the tower. Therefore the review should be for the exterior only

I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here's a revised review for the exterior of Kyoto Tower:

""During my recent trip to Kyoto, I had the opportunity to see the stunning Kyoto Tower from the outside. The tower is an impressive sight to behold, with its sleek, modern design towering above the surrounding buildings. I was struck by the tower's unique shape, which made it stand out even more among the city's skyline.

Even from a distance, I could see the intricate details that had gone into the tower's construction. The exterior was clean and well-maintained, with no signs of wear and tear. I appreciated the effort that had gone into ensuring that the tower remained an impressive landmark that represented the best of modern architecture.

Overall, I highly recommend a visit to see the Kyoto Tower from the outside. It's a must-see attraction that truly captures the spirit of the city, and its beauty and grandeur are sure to leave a lasting impression.""",no,,view review

One of the iconic landmark in Kyoto.

Athleticgirl 86,2023-04-17 14:12:37,5,0,"Kyoto Tower at night, so until 21:00 you can go up. Worthwhile in any case, if you want to see the city at night from above. You also have a great view of the station of Kyoto.

Sanka Illangakoon,2023-04-24 13:47:40,4,0,"Kyoto Tower is an iconic landmark in the heart of the city, offering panoramic views of Kyoto from its observation deck. At 131 meters tall, the tower is one of the tallest buildings in Kyoto and provides breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains and cityscape.

You might find it confusing to find the ticketing office as it really is. The ticketing office is located in level B1 and then you will have to visit another floor before being tranferred to the lift that'll take you to the top. While it may not be the most historic attraction in Kyoto, Kyoto Tower is a must-visit for those looking to take in the city's beauty from above.

Mariee M.,2023-05-02 06:28:34,3,0,"Kyoto is a flat city(geographically I mean), so I don't recommend enjoying the night view of this tower. If you want to enjoy the spectacular night view of the city, I recommend Harukas 300 or Umeda Air Garden in Osaka instead.
The admission fee is 900 yen, and you can pay by credit card.

René Ratschiller,2023-05-03 01:52:32,4,0,"Pretty much the only viewpoint in Kyoto, but if you are not crazy for viewpoints, this is not a ""must see"". It's a pretty small observatory and it costs 900¥ per person.

Doug Neilson,2023-05-03 14:04:18,4,0,"Close to main railway station. The tower gives very good views all over Kyoto ( if viewing weather is OK).  About 900 yen to enter, using two lifts via 11th floor of building. Rather old fashioned interior ( the tower dates to 1960s). Two levels of viewing gallery, free telescopes, and interpretation screens.  Well worth a visit, which will take 45 minutes or so.  May be queues at peak times.

James Milner,2023-05-13 08:37:02,3,0,"At 9k yen the entry is a bit expensive. It's the tallest structure in the city and the views are nice. The tower is an older structure and it shows - though that adds some charm.

Debbie Fogel,2023-06-02 11:00:21,4,0,"Smaller observation tower.  It's near the main train station, which is about 20 mins from most Kyoto attractions.  Worth a quick visit.  I went up shortly after sunset, but I think day views would be better.

Samantha Smith,2023-06-03 12:53:17,3,0,"This was one of our last stops in Kyoto while we visited. It's an iconic location for sure and super easy to get to (just walk out of Kyoto Station and it's right there towering over you!). Tickets were quick to purchase and the initial elevator up was quite quick. We went in the afternoon on a Saturday and, after a short queue for yet another elevator, we made it to the observation deck. This deck is small and crowded, so it makes it hard to get a good view out the windows. However, the view was wonderful and it was a beautiful clear arvo.
The binoculars that are stationed around the circular deck are well positioned and are free to use. These were a standout, it was quite fun watching people eat their dinner from afar 😂 there are also interactive touch screens around the deck also that you can use.
