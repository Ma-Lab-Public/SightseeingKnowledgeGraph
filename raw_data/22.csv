グルメ旅ike,2023-01-09 17:01:27,5,0," It is a shrine visited by famous stars who are active in the entertainment world, mainly Johnny's.

At the same time, it has become a splendid tourist destination as a sacred place for Janiota people.

Good access to stop by on your way back from Arashiyama. What a shrine. It's right in front of you when you get off the station.

The enshrined deity is Yorinari Kiyohara. Currently, it is an independent shrine that does not belong to the shrine headquarters.

As a ""good luck shrine"", power stone amulets are also sold.

Weekends are really crowded, so if you want to go sightseeing, go on weekdays.

sei chou,2023-01-09 21:33:13,4,2," I went to hatsumode on the 2th. It was evening, but I waited in line for 50 minutes to visit the shrine. Because it is the god of performing arts, the tags of celebrities are lined up, and it is full of people who are selling well. The security guard of the traffic control guides, was there an accident? ✨ I misunderstood. It's young women and Abek, and there aren't many older people like me. My mother used to go there every year, so it was to buy and send an amulet. I hope you like it ☀️
I went again on the 4th, I lost my lucky charm and the lottery during the first visit of the new year, so I pulled it again, Daikichi (laughs) I was hoping for Nakakichi, so let's say it's okay✨

na aki,2023-01-11 03:40:55,4,1," I visited this shrine because it was recommended by Mr. Chankawai.

It is a very wonderful shrine.
Business hours are from 9:30, but it seems that purchases such as amulets can be purchased earlier than this time.

Other than that, there are many people who visit the shrine even on weekdays and it is quite lively with Kansai nori, so if you want to take your time and concentrate with your amulet, I think it is better to go early when there are few people.

Also, as a countermeasure against corona, there is no ladle in the wash basin, and the water itself does not flow and circulate, so it is better to prepare a plastic bottle of water in advance.

ゆゆ,2023-01-11 15:57:33,5,2," The trigger was that I asked an acquaintance to buy me a charm, and I made a wish as written on the attached paper. Three wishes I made at that time came true, and a few years later, I went to the site with gratitude and received a new amulet. The wishes I made at the time of the visit (to marry my boyfriend who was with me, etc.) came true safely, so I would like to go back with my husband to thank him again.

Nature boy,2023-01-18 08:24:02,5,1," The weather was good, but I guess you could say the atmosphere was good...
The temple had a wonderful atmosphere.

The god of performing arts is also enshrined, so there are many names of well-known people in the precincts (it's not a donation, but there are many names of people who did such things in the precincts), so it's a blessing. I realize....

It's not a difficult place to come to, so I think it's extraordinarily worth visiting.

I immediately set the image of ""Kiyome-no-sha"" as my wallpaper!

【postscript】
Immediately after visiting here, my wish came true!
It may be beneficial to visit Yasui Konpiragu Shrine as a set, but I think it's better to visit and pray according to the guide!

The names of famous people are lined up in a row, so it's a shrine that makes you want to try your best to stand next to them someday.

The first time I visited was a place I remember going with my father when I was in fifth grade. It's been about 20 years since then, but I never thought I would become a performer.
Life is all about the horse. I don't know what will happen, but I want to continue performing arts until I die, so the next time I visit, I will make Senjafuda and stick it up.
