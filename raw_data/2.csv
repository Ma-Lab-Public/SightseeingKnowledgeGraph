It is outside of Kyoto city and you get to take a bus through the beautiful mountain range. It is quite a walk to get from the bus stop to the entrance so bring comfortable shoes. You can easily lose track of time exploring all of the trails that line the temple. Last time I visited they were filming scenes for a television show, so never know what you can see when visiting. At the very end of the temple you can purchase tiny clay plates that you can through off the side of a cliff. You are trying to hit the river at the bottom.

Trans-word plus TGM,2018-11-29 15:50:14,5,1,Jingoji Temple was established on the top of Mt. Takao by Wakano Kiyomaro in 824 as a merger of two other grand temples in the same region ( Kozanji Temple and Saimyoji Temple ). Mt. Takao is a part of mountainous chain of Mt. Atago located in the north-east of Ayashiyama along Kiyotaki River. The temple belongs to Koyasan Shingon sect of Buddhism. The main object of worship in Jingoji is Yakushi Nyorai statue which is believed to have a healing power. The temple also holds 15 other National Treasures of Japan including a sacred writing of Saint Kukai. This temple covers a massive area upon the mountainous ground for you to walk around in its precincts. The temple is very popular among visitors in early Autumn.

Luigi,2020-04-15 20:54:28,5,0,"In my travel in Japan a stayed in a ryokan near Takao-san. I did read there was a peaceful Buddhist temple, the Jingoji and based on what people said I really wanted to visit it. So, me and my friends made the 260 steps (if I remember well) and we did reach the temple. It wasn't too hard, but even if we should made a very hard hike I can tell you it was whorty. We went in spring, during the sakura blossom, just to add more beauty to the place. It really is a place of peace: I'm not buddhist but I really got the feeling of a place suspended in another time. There was silence, you could only hear the noise of nature. The landscape was really beautiful and the temple give you the feeling of a sacred place. Like I said, the cherry blossom contributed a lot to the beauty of this place. Only two buildings of the temple are originals. The others were destroyed by fire and rebuilted in modern era. The temple ha a number of national treasures as some buddhist statues (but right now even the statues are a replica) and an ancient calligraphy written by the priest Kukai. You will see a small river, the Kiyotaki. Just pay attention to the hour when you visit it: when we went there the temple closed at 4 p.m.. So, if you come from Kyoto, keep in mind that you have to leave early, because Takaosan is 50 km from the city. The owner of the ryokan told us in autumn during the foliage is also very spectacular. And I saw some pictures who confirm that it's true. If one day I'll go back to Kyoto Takao San and Jingoji temple will be a secure stop.

Romy K,2021-05-22 00:12:27,5,5," The temple treasure exhibition from May 1st to May 5th, which is also known as the extermination of treasure insects, is different from the usual art exhibitions, and you can see 6 national treasures, including the statues of Minamoto no Yoritomo and Taira no Shigemori, and many other important cultural properties up close.

The treasure exhibition has been canceled for 2020 and 2021 in a row, but I just hope that the corona disaster will end soon and I will be able to see it again.

However, it is one of my favorite temples because it is fun to see many buildings and trees without it.

Also, public transportation is not very good. If you take public transportation from Kyoto Station, take the JR Bus Takao Tohoku Line for about an hour, get off at Yamashiro Takao and walk for about 20 minutes one way on a paved road in the mountains. If you go with that intention, it's a pleasant road in the shade of trees.

The kawarake nage, in which unglazed plates are thrown from the observatory toward the valley below, is also famous. I tried it too, but it made me feel good.
It is said that it was originally built as a temple for Wake no Kiyomaro. Kobo Daishi once served as chief priest, but it fell into disrepair for a time, and was revived by Mongaku Shonin in the late Heian period. After that, many halls were destroyed by fire during the Onin War, and have been rebuilt since the Edo period. However, valuable Buddhist statues and documents from the Heian and Kamakura periods remain. The statue of Yakushi Nyorai, the principal image of worship, is a national treasure.

It was a pity that the goshuin was prepared instead of being written directly.
Also, the parking lot next to Momijiya (along the curve) along the national highway is 500 yen, but the rest is 1000 yen. It's a few minutes walk, but if you don't want to walk because there are stairs, you might want to get off at the riverside parking lot, which you can enter a little further ahead.

Located at the foot of Mt. Takao, it is a famous place for autumn leaves. As Wake no Kiyomaro's clan temple, it has a long history as it was founded in the late Nara period. After returning from Tang, Kukai served as the chief priest for 14 years before entering Koyasan.

The entrance fee is 600 yen. After climbing 350 steep stone steps and passing through the tower gate, you can see the wide precincts. If you don't have time to spare, first visit the Bell Tower.

From the parking lot along National Route 162 Shuzan Kaido, we pass through red-stained maple trees and reach Takao Bridge over the Kiyotaki River. You can see the steep stone steps leading up to the precincts, climb over 350 steps at a stretch, and when you start to see the teahouse along the stone steps, you've advanced 80% of the way. I wanted to see the two-storied gate over the stone steps, but unfortunately, it is under restoration work, and I cannot see Jikokuten and Zochoten, who stare at me from both sides.

I went on 12/11, but the autumn leaves are almost over, and there are a large number of fallen leaves on the approach. Thanks to that, I was able to visit the shrine comfortably with few people, so I recommend visiting temples and shrines only during the off-season.

The statue of Yakushi Nyorai, a single wooden statue (national treasure), the principal image of worship, the Nikko Bodhisattva Moonlight Bodhisattva, and the Twelve Divine Generals statues are all accessible up to the inner sanctuary, so you can see them up close.

Take a bus from Kyoto City and get off at Takao (city bus) or Yamashiro Takao (JR bus). From here, go down to the riverside of Kiyotaki River, cross the Takao Bridge and climb back up (there is also a hiking course from Kyoto Bus Kiyotaki, which is also recommended).
To be honest, the climb from the Kaohsiung Kanko Hotel at the entrance to the Jingoji Tower Gate is quite tough, so please wear comfortable shoes and take your time. There are teahouses along the way, but they don't seem to be open during the off-season.
Unfortunately, the gate is currently under construction. If you buy an admission ticket and pass through the precincts, the precincts are quite large, and there are halls such as Myoo-do, Godaido, and Bishamon-do, but the highlight is the Kondo, which is located on the stone steps. The building itself was rebuilt in the Showa period, but the Yakushi Nyorai, a national treasure enshrined inside, was created in the early Heian period. The statues of the Twelve Divine Generals on both sides are also quite impressive.
In addition, the portrait of Minamoto no Yoritomo (reproduction) and Takao Mandala, which are familiar in textbooks, are also on display.
In general, it's not flashy, but when I think about the reasons why a temple was built on this outskirts of Kyoto and think back to the past, I'm deeply moved. The autumn leaves are of course beautiful, but we recommend visiting here during a quiet season.

I was sweating profusely on the 350 steps up to the entrance of Jingoji Temple. It's too late, but I regret a little that I shouldn't go in the summer ( ¬¥‚àÄÔΩÄ )

In the main area, everything is so big that it feels like you are in the presence of giants. Lovely just to walk around agape at the sight of it all. In early foliage season the mix of colors turned into this beautiful rainbow pattern in my phone's camera. This temple is worth the trip, which seems pretty easy to do by city bus, to get away from the crowds and get a temple with a very different feel from the ones in the city.

It is a place that you want to visit around noon, as there are many things that are in shadow in the afternoon.
Since it was a weekday, there were not many tourists, so I was able to enjoy the autumn leaves slowly. The temple is beautiful and I would like to visit again.

It was a round-trip bus, but it was packed even on weekdays, so basically you couldn't sit down.
There is a pay parking lot of 1000 yen in the middle of the public road curve, and there is a pedestrian crossing in front of the Takao bus stop, so please slow down and be careful.
They tell me that I'm old, that my bag is in the way, and that it's in the way of taking pictures. Please be aware that there are loud flies on the bus and in the precincts.
At lunch time, everyone is early in the morning so you can eat properly lol
Around 12 o'clock, the number of people suddenly decreases.
It might be a good idea to aim for a slightly later time around that time than early in the morning.
The legs are not good and there are ups and downs, so we recommend that you think of it as a hike.

When people suddenly disappear, there are occasional moments when it is so quiet that you can hear the sound of falling leaves.
I feel really glad that I came here.
There are national treasures and the air is delicious.

After all, it is a temple located in the mountains of Takao, so you will be healed by the quiet atmosphere that is clearly different from the temples and shrines in the tourist areas of Kyoto city.
Founded by Wake no Kiyomaro in the Heian period, this temple has a long history and has been protected by successive generations of powerful figures.
The statue of Yakushi Nyorai, a national treasure in the main hall, has a mysterious appearance that attracts people at first sight.
In addition, the statue of Minamoto no Yoritomo, which everyone has seen at least once in history textbooks, is a national treasure handed down at this temple.
There is a place in the precincts where you can throw earthenware to ward off evil, and the view from there is spectacular.
You can also go by bus from the city, but I think that it is better to use a rental car because there is a distance. On the way from the city to Jingo-ji, there are Kinkaku of Rokuon-ji, Ryoan-ji, Ninna-ji, etc., and you can also go from Arashiyama.
From the parking lot at the foot of the mountain to the main hall of Jingo-ji Temple, there is a tremendous amount of stone steps to climb, so it is recommended that you wear sneakers or other comfortable shoes when visiting.
There are several teahouses along the way for those with weak legs.

There is a teahouse on the way and you can take a break, but anyway, I walked all the way to the tower gate.
After finally arriving, passing through the two-storied gate, the Kondo and Bishamon-do temples stand side by side with autumn leaves in the wide precincts.
And the stone steps continue to the main hall ahead.
After climbing the stone steps and looking back, you can see the wonderful scenery of autumn leaves and stone steps.

KEN (FARMING IN THE CITY),2023-03-04 18:17:55,5,0," He Qingmalu, the advocate of peaceful relocation of the capital and the promoter of new urban construction, established the Shingan Temple in Hanoi in order to pray for the country's safety in the first year of Tianying (781), and at almost the same time, established a temple in Shancheng. Private Temple Kaohsiung Mountain Temple.

It has not been confirmed because there is no exact information showing where Jinganji Temple is actually located, but according to legend, Wake Seimaro asked the oracle of Usa Hachiman to receive ""All Sutras to be copied, Buddha statues erected, and Susho King Sutras to be recited."" , build a temple, and pray for the safety of all generations"", the temple was built in order to fulfill his wish, and it was named after it.

In addition, Takao-san Temple, which was established as a private temple, is said to be one of the Atago Five Temples above 900 meters above sea level. Therefore, the purpose of establishing this temple is not just Wakiji's Bodhi Temple, but for those who have felt the urban Buddhism of Nara. A dojo established by monks who are tired and want to practice mountain training.

Atago Five Temples, also known as Atago Five Squares, include Baiyun Temple, Yuelun Temple, Rilun Temple, Chuanfa Temple and Gaoxiongshan Temple, but unfortunately, only Gaoxiongshan Temple has been renamed Shenhu Temple and Yuelun Temple retains this name.

Later, after Kiyomaro's death, Kiyomaro's tomb was enshrined in the Kaohsiung Temple and became Wake's Bodhi Temple. Kiyomaro's sons (Hiroyo, Mazuna, and Nakayo) inherited his father's behest and invited Saicheng and Kukai to Kaohsiung Temple one after another. , Bringing a new atmosphere to the Buddhist world.

Brothers Hiroshi and Mazuna asked Saisumi, who was practicing in Mount Hiei, to give an explanation of the Lotus Sutra at Takao Sanji Temple.

After the first explanation of Heian Buddhism this time, Saicheng became a foreign student and went to the Tang Dynasty.

In addition, Kukai went to Tang Dynasty with Saisumi as a foreign student, but he returned to China after two years, and was not allowed to enter Kyoto until three years later. He was invited to Kaohsiung Mountain Temple, and maintained a friendship with Kaohsiung Mountain Temple for several years, and then developed the communication between Tiantai Sect and Shingon Sect.

Finally, in the first year of Tencho (824), at the request of Shinzuna and Nakashi, Shinganji Temple and Takao Sanji Temple were merged and renamed Shengo Kokjo Shingon Temple (referred to as Jingo Temple), and everything was entrusted to Kukai. The Shingon sect has been handed down to this day.

With the efforts of Saicheng and Kukai, Jingoji Temple established the content of the root dojo. However, in two fires in the fifth year of Zhengli (994) and the fifth year of Jiu'an (1149), Jingoji Temple was destroyed, and the mountain collapsed completely, which angered Emperor Toba.

Seeing this tragic situation, Wen Jue decided to take the revival of the Shenhu Temple as his lifelong wish, but the road to achieve this goal is very grim.

However, with the help of disciples such as Shangjue and Minghui, who are highly respected, Jinguoji Temple was restored to a larger scale than before.

Since then, Jingoji Temple still adheres to the light of Buddhism despite the war disaster in the Tianwen era and the abolition of Buddha in the early Meiji era.

miki,2023-06-06 09:15:28,5,1," Jingo-ji Temple was founded by Wake no Kiyomaro, who presented Emperor Kanmu with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmoving the capital to Heian-kyo. It is famous for Saicho giving lectures on the Lotus Sutra at Jingoji Temple at the request of Wake no Kiyomaro's eldest son, Hiroyo, and for Kobo Daishi Kukai, who had just returned from Tang China, where he served as chief priest for 14 years. After that, it declined, but was revived by Mongaku Shonin with the support of Minamoto no Yoritomo and others.

The access method is guided to get off at the ""Kaohsiung"" bus stop of the JR bus / municipal bus, but if you get off at the ""Kaohsiung"" bus stop, you will have to walk a road with steep stairs.

I find it easier to get off at the Makino-o bus stop, which is one stop further ahead, and walk along the Kiyotaki River from the side of the nearby restaurant called Yoshiden. This road has no stairs, almost no cars, and is easy to walk because it is a gentle paved road (although you will have to pass twice in front of Saimyoji Temple).

The time required for viewing is at least 90 minutes from the Takao Bridge over the Kiyotaki River. If you are a good walker and want to go to Wake no Kiyomaro's grave or Mongaku Shonin's grave, it might take a whole day.

If you do the Mio Meguri, you will have to separate Jingo-ji/Saimyoji and Kozan-ji temples, otherwise you will be in a rush and you won't be able to fully see the temples.

The stone steps on the approach to Jingoji Temple are quite long and the slope is steep, so I climbed it after a break. In the middle of the steep stone steps, there is a large rock called Suzuriishi that Kobo Daishi Kukai scraped his ink on. There is an entrance to the disaster prevention road of Jingoji Temple, and although general vehicles are not allowed to pass in principle, it is good to climb on foot.Using this road, you can reach a little below the tower gate without using the long stone steps. can go).

After climbing the stone steps, pay 600 yen at the reception on the left side of the tower gate and enter the mountain. On a weekday in late May, there were no statues of Niten on either side of the gate, probably because I visited during the off-season.

After passing through the two-storied gate, the flat and spacious precincts spread out, and on the right hand side you can see the treasure storehouse, Wakeko Mausoleum, and Myoo-do Hall.

Godaido, Bishamon-do, and Daishi-do temples are built in the order in front of the Kondo. Yes, it is possible to skip the stone steps).

In 1623 (Genna 9), the tower gate, Godaido, Bishamondo (former Kondo), and bell tower were rebuilt.

You can get a goshuin (first ear fee 300 yen) on the right hand side when you enter the main hall. In front of the place where you can get the goshuin, there is a copy of Kobo Daishi Kukai's own handwritten Kanjo Rekimei and a replica of the Takao Mandala.

The temple staff explained various things, such as, ``The numbers given to the names of the initiation records are randomly assigned, so it may have been added later for ranking.''

In the center of the main hall, there is a wooden statue of Yakushi Nyorai, the principal image of worship, but it is a bare wood statue, about 170 cm high, and it is rather small, and the inside of the hall is dim and difficult to see. The impact of the statues of the Twelve Divine Generals on both sides and the replica (probably the actual size) of the statue of Minamoto no Yoritomo on the left side after entering the main hall are even more impressive.

Along the way from the main hall to the famous kawarake nage (200 yen for 3 pieces), there are the Akai well and Jizo-in Temple, which are said to have been dug by Kobo Daishi Kukai for his rituals. In front of Jizo-in Temple, there is a stone monument with a haiku written by Toshiro Nomura, ``Hatsumomiji seru hajirahi wo sugikakomi''.

The kawarake is thrown toward the Kiyotaki River valley (this area is apparently called Kinunkei), and the view from here is exceptional.

The temple is famous for its autumn foliage, but the green maple leaves in the fresh green season are also wonderful. It was very nice to be able to listen to the Haruzemi chorus in the precincts.
