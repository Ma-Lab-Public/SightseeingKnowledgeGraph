Tilman Baumann,2017-02-26 06:44:41,3,1,"The aquarium is mostly geared towards the display of cetaceans. Which is a shame because I have issues with that. Especially in Japan.

There are a few beautiful freshwater nature aquariums and seawater aquariums.
Definitely worth the visit, perhaps not worth the entrance fee.

While I'm all for children having this experience. I'm quite appalled by the behaviour of those kids towards the animals. Nobody seems to mind knocking and kicking the aquariums.
Some of the displays are also way too small for the type of fish.

Mixed feelings.
Writing this in the serene and beautiful market garden with serpentine waterfall. Nice.

PS: The newts and salamander big and small are quite cool. In tastefully decorated tanks.

David Anderson,2017-06-05 10:46:42,4,0,"Swayed between 3 and 4 stars, giving it the benefit of the doubt as I can't do 3.5...

Overall good attraction, some of the displays do seem cramped, I'm not an expert though...

Also the layout had me confused leading to a couple of times where I almost walked out of the place by accident, was just lucky I thought I must have done something wrong and went back...

I did like the focus on local water life, and the displays have some very effective lighting, highlighting the animals very well.

Carl English,2018-05-28 14:15:07,5,1,"Great little aquarium! It's small, but very well done. There's a captivating jellyfish room, penguins, seals, eels and a delightful dolphin show for $20 per adult, all in. Little kids are free. Food is decent but overpriced (no surprise there). Very little English signage, so just go for the fun of it. Also, dolphins! If a dolphin show doesn't put a big grin on your face, see a doctor.

Troy N,2018-07-16 03:46:32,4,0,"This is a small little aquarium in a city known for its historic temples and buildings. It seems almost out of place when one looks at its gleaming except and modern lines.

I enjoyed visiting this aquarium because in a fish geek but I've seen better. The large tank with the sardine school was pretty cool as was the beautiful goldfish and aquarium displays. I was quite taken by the giant salamander exhibit and wanted to get one of those large stuffed ones for a body pillow but that was squashed by my boss.

Overall a nice aquarium and worth the admission fee but don't expect the Osaka aquarium....

Christopher C,2018-07-17 04:24:16,5,2,"The aquarium is rather small compared to other aquariums, but definately worth a visit. They had seals, jellyfish, penguins, etc but the main attraction you should definately not miss is the dolphin show. It was just breathtaking. I think there are posted times for when each show occures during the day, but I'm not positive. Also, if you happen to be a university student, showing your student card gives you a discount.

Tch Goya,2021-09-14 08:03:29,5,0,"The moment you enter the aquarium, you'll encounter the giant salamanders native to Kamogawa. The aquarium has all the freshwater and saltwater fish found around Kyoto. You can get some ideas about how Kyoto's water is so blessed with nature, how ecological cycle functions here, etc. You can also get to see some furseals, and penguins too (I'm pretty sure they're not native to Japan). Unlike other aquariums, the facility is so clean and well maintained, wheelchairs accessible hallways, very enjoyable and at the same time educational. So highly recommended five-star for this aquarium, bring your kids here too, they'll be so happy. Even for adults you can enjoy by yourself for at least an hour and a half. And I you do have some extra time, you should also visit the Kyoto Railway Museum located in its vicinity. Must go!

This is a standard aquarium with all the usual species, plus some focus on Japanese wildlife. The structure of the building makes the visit easy to navigate, there are plenty of accessible bathrooms and cafes to rest between one display to another. What I appreciated the most is that the day I went there there was no dolphin show because the dolphins were resting. I wasn't disappointed at all, because they explained that the dolphins had to rest. I felt it was great that they did this, because dolphins should also have days off. We could still go on the roof top to see them interact naturally. So it felt like they were taking good care of the dolphins, and all the animals in general, which makes it quite enjoyable.

The penguin exhibit is also famous - especially the super detailed love/friendship map of each of the penguins in the exhibit! Featured on TV, it takes up a whole wall! Lovingly documented by the staff, it has some funny annotations to read about which penguins have dated each other, which have a crush on certain staff members, etc. Finally, there's the dolphin show.

Graham Blackburn,2023-05-19 14:26:30,5,0,"Enjoyed this a lot. Especially seeing the jellyfish up close and in different life stages too was a bonus.
The penguins was so cute and love the seals.

Can get busy with school activities but its no problem as long as you enjoy walking around slowly..",no,,view review

Darryl Ho,2023-05-25 21:50:44,1,0,Small and not worth the entry fee. The creatures look like they‚Äôre kept in unreasonably confined spaces,no,,view review
Roua hossam,2023-05-26 05:08:57,5,0,"A very beautiful place. It has a wonderful calmness, and the colors of the fish are wonderful, as if they were a painted painting, and there are almost all forms of lamps. The lamps were very impressive.  I highly recommend visiting it.

Nadine S,2023-06-02 11:20:10,2,0,"I do not like the majority of zoos and aquariums in Germany, because I thought this is animal cruelty - and it seems like there is no difference to the Kyoto Aquarium. A lot of ""pools"" are way too small and only do have the animals in there, without plants. You already see psychological damage in the behavior of some animals e.g. seals. Very sad...

Shahab ‚ÄúCro‚Äù Khan,2023-06-11 13:04:08,4,0,"Nice escape from the rain. A small but well done aquarium. Nice for a quick break and something different. The giant salamander are super cute and the jellyfish collection is nice. It‚Äôs great that they have a dolphin show but I don‚Äôt like cetaceans in captivity.
