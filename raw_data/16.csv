Brenda Ariesty Kusumasari,2021-08-21 11:58:37,4,0,"This bridge is quite famous and has a wonderful view during clear day. Unfortunately we went during rainy and extremely cloudy day so not much view was feasible. But the mist on the surrounding hills was somehow majestic. Lots of people take photos with this bridge as background. There are some gentleman offering rickshaw tour. The bridge itself is pretty crowded with vehicles so just be aware your safety during walking.

Kyoto Dream Trips,2021-09-26 09:51:39,5,13,"Watching the Harvest Moon rising over the Togetsuky≈ç Bridge in Arashiyama.
The almost full Harvest Moon (Waxing Gibbous 98.8%) coming over the Mountains surrounding Arashiyama. A few people were waiting for the moonrise, and when it became visible, there were some shrieks of excitement. Some shivers went down my spine, and it's always thrilling to experience it. Hundreds of years ago, the Kyoto aristocracy came here to watch the Harvest Moon and recite poetry. I wonder what else they did. No wonder the Togetsuky≈ç bridge is fittingly called the ""Moon Crossing Bridge"".

Saurabh,2021-12-24 02:55:58,5,5,"One of the oldest bridges in Japan, first constructed around 900 AD (during Nara period). The whole bridge is illuminated with vibrant purple lighting during training the 2nd and 3rd week of December, locally called the Hanatoro event. Be mindful that if you take the JR line or Randen, you will arrive at the Saga Arashiyama station which is already on the right side of bridge and towards Arashiyama bamboo forest. To start from the beginning of the bridge, you would need to take the Hankyu line to arrive at Hankyu Arashiyama station, different from Saga Arashiyama station.

Santosh Shrestha,2022-02-10 22:04:19,4,1,"One of the oldest bridge in japan.
Was built about 900AD.
Watched many times in TV and finally able to watch live.
Takes about 10min to cross the bridge.
It really has a historical value.
However I would say its just a normal bridge.

Alyssa Becker,2023-04-22 06:05:33,3,0,"Beautiful but very crowded bridge.  Looking at it over the river is much nicer than trying to cross it (at almost any time of day).  We were there at 4:30 PM and it was hard not to fall off the sidewalk with the number of people.  But it didn't help that people would randomly stop every few meters for pictures either.  Way cross as needed - but don't expect to be amazed by the experience.  To enjoy the bridge, sit on a bench along the river and stare at it from a distance.  Then you get to see the rushing water and cherry blossoms (or fall colours) and ignore the people.
