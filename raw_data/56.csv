South of Honen-in Temple.

The autumn foliage season is very beautiful, but I visited on November 3rd, which is still early.

In front of the temple gate, there is a stone pillar carved with the words ``Jodo Rei Sanne Motochi, Enko Daishi Sacred Site''.

According to the information board of Kyoto City in the precincts, it is as follows (summary).
Called Jurenzan, it is a temple of the Jodo sect.
At the beginning of the Kamakura period, two disciples of Honen Shonin, Sumirenbo and Anrakubo, built a training hall about one kilometer east of the present location and encouraged people to practice the nembutsu. By chance, an incident occurred in which Princesses Matsumushi and Suzumushi, court ladies of the Retired Emperor Gotoba, were educated and secretly entered into the priesthood. Heh, Shinran Shonin was exiled to Echigo.
This is the so-called Ken'ei 2nd year Buddhist persecution, but at the end of the Muromachi period, this temple was rebuilt in order to hold a memorial service for two priests.
In the main hall, the principal image of Amida Sanzon is enshrined, and beside it, there are seated statues of Juren, Anraku, Princesses Matsumushi and Suzumushi, and a statue of Honen.

It is said that there is a five-ring stone pagoda of Matsumushi and Suzumushi in the eastern mountains that can be seen in the back of the garden.

The atmosphere is very calm.
After hearing about the history of this temple at the hall, it is very relaxing to spend some time looking at the beautiful garden, the greenery of the mountains, and the flowing clouds.

Retired Emperor Gotoba's concubines Matsumushi and Suzumushi were inspired by the sermons of Honen's disciples Juren and Anraku, and secretly entered into the priesthood to arouse the Emperor's wrath. The temple was built in 1681 to mourn for two priests.

The wooden statues and stone pagodas of Sumiren and Anraku, Matsumushi and Suzumushi convey the tragedy. It is open to the public in spring and autumn. The Shishigaya Pumpkin Memorial Service is famous for the midsummer festival ""July 25th"".

‰πÖ‰øùÁî∞‰Ω≥Â≠ê,2022-11-05 13:30:06,5,1," I visited on the morning of the first day of the autumn release. Even before the doors opened, less than 10 people were waiting. At the main hall, we received a detailed explanation of the temple, and saw a hanging scroll and a moss garden. The autumn leaves are a little early this year. It's a small temple, but it was worth seeing.
There was also a cafe, although I didn't use it.

san NN,2022-11-22 14:43:23,3,0," Jurenzan Anrakuji Temple, sect of Jodo sect (independent), principal image of Buddha is Amida Nyorai
The mountain name is derived from Jurenbo, a disciple of Honen Shonin, and the temple name is also derived from Anrakubo.
Famous as a temple for the ""pumpkin memorial service"" held in July every year.

The history of the temple begins when the two of them signed a draft in Shishigaya, east of here.
The ladies of Gotoba-in (Princess Matsumushi and Princess Suzumushi) became priests while visiting the Emperor Kumano.
Infuriated by this, Gotoba-in sentenced Juren and Anraku to death, and exiled Honen to an island.
After Honen returned to Kyoto, he revived the draft under their names in memory of them.

There is a memorial tower for two princesses in the southeast of the precincts, and a memorial tower for two priests in the south.

ÏïàÌÉúÏàò,2022-11-25 07:29:16,4,0," 11/20 Admission fee for visiting is 500 yen
The foliage at the entrance is art. You can go just by looking at the foliage at the entrance.
The inside is a simple temple, and you can go inside and relax while looking at the garden.
It's quiet with the sound of birds, so it's good to sit and rest haha

The entrance is a thatched gate, which matches the autumn leaves very well and is beautiful. ü•≥üåüüåüüåü

There is a very chic and beautiful cafe in the precincts, so if all the cafes along the Philosopher's Path are full, we recommend using this placeüòÜ
It was very empty even at the peak of autumn leaves on Sundayüåüüåüüåüüåü
Brulee and cake were also very deliciousü§©

YuChung Chen (ÈÅ†ÂÖâ),2022-12-05 08:59:04,5,0," The color change time of the red leaves at the mountain gate is slightly different from that inside. If you only want to take pictures of the red leaves, you can go in without spending money. The inside is actually a bit bigger than imagined. There is a small courtyard where you can sit and rest, or pay to enter the built-in coffee shop. Not being crowded is the biggest advantage.

JH Jung,2022-12-10 09:38:24,4,0," This place was selected as the 7th best spot for autumn leaves in Kyoto by Kyoto Magazine.

Even if you peek inside in front of the closed front door, the autumn leaves are very beautiful.
At the time of my visit, a notice was attached stating that worship was refused, and the entrance door was closed.
Looking at the notice, it seemed that it was only open on certain days.
A beautiful autumn foliage spot worth taking a look around on the way to the Philosopher's Path.

I was able to listen to the story of the lady-in-waiting Matsumushi and Suzumushi in the temple, and I was able to understand the history, and it was very good to go out.

N,2023-05-30 23:22:23,4,0," It wasn't open to the public when I went. It can be visited during special times. There seems to be no shortage of historical stories behind this temple. There is something beyond knowing about the story about the shaving of Princesses Matsumushi and Suzumushi, ladies-in-waiting of the Retired Emperor Gotoba, and the tragedy of the legal persecution that followed.
