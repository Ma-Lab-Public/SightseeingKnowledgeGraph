aaron meldahl,2017-01-18 12:25:08,4,1,"This temple is probably not on anybody's list of top places to visit while in Kyoto, given the far more famous sights in the area. It takes a bit to understand its history, so four stars for the relative obscurity. The original buildings burned down, so what exists now are modern, but sliding doors painted by one of the most important Japanese artists and his son (it's a sad story) were saved and are on display in a small museum. A recreation of the room they graced faces an original garden notable for the fact its pond fills the entire foreground and extends under the structure. It's an interesting contrast to the typical dry garden image of Kyoto temples. Stop by if you have time to spare.

Famous National Treasures Tohaku Hasegawa and Kyuzo's cherry blossom and maple paintings. The scenic garden, which is said to be Rikyu's favorite garden, is modeled after China's Mount Lushan. There are so many things to see, such as the gentle gaze of Dainichi Nyorai, the main deity of the main hall, the powerful and impressive Fudo Myo-o, enshrined in Negoro-ji Temple, and the fusuma paintings of Chishaku-in Auditorium. There is a restaurant on the premises, and you can also stay overnight. You can get a red stamp at the entrance.

In the main hall, the monks recite sutras, and we burn incense and sit on chairs to watch over them. It was cold, but I felt very comfortable. After completing the duties at the Kondo, we move to the Myo-o-den, where we recite the sutras while performing the goma fire. Here too, I burned incense and watched while sitting on a chair.

After all the duties were completed, I was allowed to tour the garden, and I was also allowed to see the precious national treasure Tohaku Hasegawa's partition painting.

Thank you very much for spending a very meaningful time with me. I would also like to thank the monk for his detailed explanation of the facility.

The garden from the Momoyama period is famous, but the plum blossoms have just started to bloom, so it's not the best time to see it.
That's not bad.
Another highlight is Hasegawa Tohaku's wall paintings, which are also national treasures and housed in the Treasure Museum.
Although it has faded as expected, it is wonderful to be able to appreciate the real thing directly instead of looking through the glass.
You can listen to the explanation of the picture with an automatic voice, so I feel that you can understand it better if you listen to it while looking at it.
Unfortunately, the main hall is currently undergoing renovations, so you can't go inside, but the neighboring Myo-o-den enshrines Fudo Myo-o, so why not stop by?

On the other hand, if you didn't mind the time loss, it would be good to get on the bus at lundom and enjoy the adventure. Kyoto is not a big city. You can get excited for 230 yen per ride.

Today, I should have turned left at Yasaka Shrine corner on Shijo-dori, the bus I took turned right and went South on Higashiyama Dori.

Junes Tran,2023-04-07 00:39:51,5,0,"This is a beautiful temple with beautiful wood floors and walkways, beautiful wall paintings, and a beautiful tranquil garden. The whole place is vibrant and shines with life. It is clean and well-cared for, fresh and refreshing, a quiet place to sit and lift your spirits. It is not visited by as many tourists as some of the other temples with gardens, so for me it was a perfect getaway! Spring makes it more gorgeous with cherries blossom.

ぴの,2023-04-12 09:38:33,5,0," The temple I was planning to visit was closed, so I tried to stretch my legs. Since it was early in the morning, there were few customers, so I was able to take a leisurely tour. ""Rikyu's favorite garden"" is a very calm scenery, and it made me feel calm. Ducks and carp were also swimming elegantly lol
The exhibition room that was recently built was also very beautiful, and I was able to see the national treasure up close. Please try to find your favorite work.

Conneric Liu,2023-04-20 02:04:49,5,0,"Wow. All facilities are brand new and well kept. We stayed overnight. Three people in a Japanese style room. They don't speak English but the reception monks use a translator device so they are very modern and prepared. The only place we encountered in Japan in our two weeks who has and use a translator device.

They have a public bath, also serve dinner and breakfast both in the common room. Looks great and taste pretty good. We ordered the regular meal but you can also upgrade.

We loved the cakes they gave us in the room. So much so that we bought a box.

At 540am you can meet them to visit the prayer /ceremony.  We did that and it was worth it. There is a tour of the grounds afterwards.  Very spiritual and calming experience. It's all in Japanese but you can get the jist by looking around.

Awesome. Recommend. Use Google translate to book on their Japanese website.",no,,view review
ケンサン,2023-04-22 06:12:39,4,2," Five 74-year-old men stayed at Chishaku-in. Chishaku-in, where I stayed this time, is a temple, but I was able to drink alcohol. We were classmates in high school, and since a few years ago, we have met twice a year until late at night to talk about memories and chronic illnesses. talking about pensions. Today's political stories and topics are endless. I can participate in the temple service the next morning, so I went to sleep around 11:00.
The next morning, I got up around 5:00 and attended the gongyo that started at 6:00. About 60 people also attended. About 20 monks recite sutras in the gongyo. Visitors were able to burn incense on the way. After the service, we visited the garden and fusuma paintings with the guidance of the temple priest. The fusuma paintings I saw at that time were not painted by Tohaku Hasegawa, but were imitations.

Do not miss the museum where the original painting works of Hasegawa Tohaku - which had earlier been displayed in the temple, but were moved to the newly built museum for better preservation - are exhibited.  These art works are of breathtaking impressive power!

レレレのショータ,2023-05-03 11:33:20,4,0," When I went there for the first time in a while, the hall and treasure hall were rebuilt.
The new treasure hall is built on the hall side
It was a separate fee from the garden
As expected, the inside of the exhibition was new, and the atmosphere of the exhibition was good, making it easier to see.

The purchase of admission tickets was replaced with a ticket vending machine, and QR code payment was also compatible, which was convenient.

You can freely take pictures in the garden and indoors, except for some areas (except for commercial purposes).
Where you can see the garden, you can also see the fusuma painting of the reproduction.

It may be unexpectedly unknown or few people visit, but there are Kondo, Myooden (Fudo Myoo is enshrined), Daishido, etc.

只見東斉,2023-05-04 12:16:53,3,0," Although it is the head temple of the Chisan sect of Shingon Buddhism, there are not many people around, so you can stroll around the temple grounds in a quiet atmosphere. Rikyu's favorite garden can also be enjoyed quietly and leisurely if done well. The fusuma paintings by Tohaku Hasegawa in the Treasure Hall can also be appreciated in the twilight of the Treasure Hall, allowing you to enjoy a quiet time.

穏やかケーコ,2023-05-31 05:19:55,5,0," Compared to Kyoto, there are relatively few tourists, and I think it is a splendid temple where you can spend a quiet time.
I was able to enjoy the paintings and wonderful gardens that were introduced in the NHK program ""History Detective"" the other day.

Fujiaki Sasaki,2023-06-09 08:09:02,4,0," In the back of the large study in front of the garden, there is a wall painting that reproduces the time, and although it is a reproduction, it is quite impressive. With the wall painting in the background, the garden with a pond that spreads out beyond the opening blends with the surrounding nature, and because there were few visitors, I was able to appreciate it quietly.

Ananas jp,2023-06-10 09:44:39,4,0," I heard that an acquaintance of mine stayed at a temple lodging at Chishakuin Temple, and the name of the temple left a strong impression on me, so I wanted to visit it once. When I visited the temple, it was smaller than I expected, but it was a well-maintained temple with gardens.

I learned about the history of this temple for the first time through the guidance provided by the Treasure Museum. I was very impressed by the revival and the establishment of Chizan doctrine.

The name Chishaku-in seems to have been the name of the 2,900 monks and the head temple of about 6,000 scholar monks during the peak period of Negoro-ji Temple, and it is like the passion of those who were involved in the history. make you feel (23/6/5 visit)

Layafille V,2023-06-11 15:57:33,5,0," Visited in the afternoon on weekdays in early June, there are not many people, you can take a leisurely walk in the temple, the garden is very beautiful, like a mountain-like landscaping, the flowing water in front of the courtyard, especially has a sense of calm close to nature. The winning works of the annual photography exhibition of Zhijiyuan are also displayed next to it, which is also very pleasing to the eye. The national treasure murals in the Treasure Hall and the Heart Sutra written by Master Hongfa are especially recommended. The murals are displayed in the exhibition space, which makes people feel very immersive, as if they are integrated into the surrounding paintings. After admiring, you can go to the Kikyo Tea House next to the Zhijiyuan Hall to have a meal or take a break for refreshments. I ordered a Yuba Donburi. The food is delicious and the service is very friendly and thoughtful. Finally, we went to the Hydrangea Garden in the rear. The scale is small, and only about 50% of the flowers are in bloom. Under the light of the setting sun, the blooming flowers are colorful, adding beautiful colors to the dark green in summer.

あめりか,2023-06-11 20:47:31,5,0," The head temple of the Chizan sect of Shingon Buddhism.
When I was sightseeing in Kyoto, there were so many shrines and temples that I didn't know what to see.
I got a charm for my mother and a goshuin.
During the daytime on weekdays, there were few people and I enjoyed the atmosphere slowly.
Colorful cloth?

After this, of course, I went to head temple on my father's side. As expected of Kyoto.

After relaxing in the garden, an hour passed in the blink of an eye.
The hydrangea was blooming beautifully on the way.

Go up to the main hall and visit Dainichi Nyorai and feel the Buddha up close. After that, when I visited Fudo-sama, it was already past noon.

It was a wonderful temple where you forget the time
