Thomas Roux,2015-02-17 02:53:59,5,0,"How do you like stairs ? You'll need to go up and up again to reach this one. Well, I would say it's worth it. Impressive gates along the way, and incredible trees whill mark your journey to the top. Then you can enjoy both the temple and a great view on the mountains. A bit far north from the city of Kyoto, but in return for the inconvenience you get a place that's not too crowded by tourists and offers a peaceful forest environment.",no,,view review

Stephanie Muringer,2017-04-26 02:50:00,5,0,"I had gone with some friends in November to hopefully see the changing leaves. It was warm enough at this point of the year that not too many of the trees changed color despite being up in the mountains. The train that leads up to the temple has seats that are oriented towards the windows for this reason (as a note, when we went they did not take the ICOCA cards at the station). It was just cool enough to keep us from overheating from the walk up the mountain from the back side. If you go towards the front of the temple its a much easier trek. Loved the tengu themes, and the tiger statues replacing typical komainu ones. This temple is a great visit for scenery away from the business of central Kyoto. Not too far away is a pretty decent onsen too.

J L,2017-12-08 09:48:27,5,5,"This was a really good hike. I know people have recommended starting the hike from kifune side. I disagree with this as starting from that end is a very difficult climb. The roots and rocks makes going up much more difficult. The view is simply stunning and although some are saying that this is just a temple... I again disagree.. people seems to forget the stunning view of nature. The tree roots that's are expose gives an eerie and ancient looking forest as you hike. However I would recommend good shoes if you are going to hike. As it starts off paved and easy from kurama but gets difficult as you continue up the woody natural path.

This gives the temple a sense of tranquility and peace. Unfortunately, it did not snow while I was there.

Thanawut C.,2018-06-15 17:30:55,4,2,"From Kyoto Station you take 3 easy trains in the morning. Then skip the cable car and walk up into the magic forest. It’s steep and you have to be able to climb 40 stories in total. Lots of cool spots along the way you’ll miss if you take the cable car. Then up and over the mountain into the town of Kibune. On the way down you’ll see some great forest scenery plus the last shrine was my favorite. Total walking time up and down with stopping for sites is about 1.75-2 hours. At town of Kibune eat lunch at one of the restaurant built over the babbling river. We went to the first one by the trail exit. After lunch, take the bus down to the train. At the last stop you can grab bus 205 to see the Golden Temple Kinkakuji if you’re having trouble fitting it into your itinerary in Kyoto given it’s a bit out of the way.

Jem Jex,2018-08-15 15:04:18,5,2,"Highly recommended if you enjoy hiking and forests. This temple is a scenic 30-mins train ride North of Kyoto, via the Eizan Kurama Line from Demachiyanagi Station. It is somewhat isolated and challenging to climb, hence you won’t find many tourists here compared to the famous Kyoto temples. Wear comfortable shoes and skip the funicular railway for a relaxing walk through the forest, surrounded by ancient pine trees, cool air, and mountain streams. As you follow the path and climb the steps to the top, you will find many small shrines along the path up, each with it’s own unique design. Upon reaching the top, you will be greeted by the temple and amazing views of the surrounding forests and mountains. There is also a bell tower a short hike above the main temple hall. It took us about 2 hours total to hike up and come back down, with stops along the way for photos.

Gary Collins,2019-04-14 06:27:27,5,2,"Special Temple for Reiki Practitioners
Visiting Kurama Dera Temple was a long awaited visit ever since taking up Reiki practice. The temple grounds may be simple and basic compared to other grand temples but this one holds something personal and extra special.

You can find the temple at the top of your walk from the station which sits on a nice elevation overlooking the forest around.

You can continue walking upwards towards the other side of the mountain enjoying the nature around you.

Very peaceful and very few people visit the area especially tourists so your in luck.

Recommendations
Go and walk from Kurama station across the mountain to kifune and enjoy nature.

Sally Cabrera,2019-12-24 07:50:17,5,1,"Kurama-Dera Temple is a must see if visiting Kyoto. The town is very calm and serene, and the scenery is unlike any other. I highly recommend the Keihan Day Pass (¥1800), which comes with commute to and from Kurama and Kibune station from the first stop. Additionally, the pass comes with free admission to Kurama-Dera Temple and free admission to the onsen. The pass also allows you to have discounts from several of the shops and restaurants, which are owned by local residents of the community. The hike from Kurama to Kibune is a little rough, but that's why you take a nice soak in the onsen right after! Kurama is my favorite place in all of Kyoto and I could never grow tired of visiting this beautiful community, abundant with nature and tranquility.

Chris 'Chant',2020-01-02 02:52:56,5,0,"If you're here I guess you're going on the hiking trail towards Kifune Shrine. You have to walk many stairs to reach Kuramadera anyway, so just take a bento or some rice balls with yourself. There are benches on the trail, don't worry, just take your time. I think you can plan this for 2 hours and I suggest going in the morning, but that's not a must to enjoy your trip.
The mountains around Kyoto are also great option if you're tired of many tourists at other attractions.
From Kifune Shrine you can return to Kyoto with the same train you came here, you just need to use local bus to get to the station.

Visiting Kurama-dera Temple was a breath of fresh air, there were only a few other people visiting, probably less than 20 total I saw throughout the day.  Incredible atmosphere with the red lanterns lining the path that light up at night.

Transportation there was fairly simple too, train to Kurama Station then a short cable car ride up.  The last cable car down is fairly early, but walking down isn't too much of a walk.

Lalu,2022-08-18 08:10:14,5,3,"This temple is in the middle of a mountain. You can hike to this temple if you start at the Gifune. You can reach this temple by cable car if you start at Kurama station. Either places you need to pay 300 yen.

I myself chose to hike. It took around 1.5 hours. It was an easy hiking. The track were paved into stairs. So you do need to have any basic hiking. You can just go there and start walking.

You got pictorial map indicating places along the hiking track such as temples, sacred altar, holy water, etc. The temple itself is beautiful. It is located among the trees. You can see part of the forest from there. However I suggest you to bring water for the hiking because the only place you can get water is at the temple in the vending machine. But most of the mineral water were sold already.

You can walk back to your initial enter spot or you can take the cable car down the mountain located near the temple. Or you can just follow the stairs down the temple up to Kurama station.

This is one of a must adventure/trip for me. It is better to come here during summer.

Poppy Love,2022-11-19 23:37:54,5,4,"WARNING!!!

This place has stunning views but DO NOT make the hike from Kifune unless you are extremely fit, or a child with boundless energy! Do not listen to people who say that you should start at Kifune because it’s “easier” — it absolutely isn’t! The first 20 mins is extremely steep(!!), with narrow, uneven steps! We arrived on a day with hoards of Japanese tourists hiking from the opposite direction (from Kurama, which is the correct way) and we knew instantly that we had made a mistake. We also walked over 2km from Kibuneguchi station to Kibune which didn’t help with our energy levels.

FACT: If you start your hike from Kurama, the steps are much wider, more even, and less steep,  making a far easier climb. Some would argue that you still have to walk uphill if you started at the base of Kurama to Kurama-dera , however, that way is also much wider, more even and less steep. It is not difficult walk at all if you are somewhat physically active. You can even take a cable car up to halfway if you decide not to walk and you will have an easier time.

If after reading this you still decide to that you want to hike from Kifune, do yourself a favour and ride the bus from Kibuneguchi station. Have a light meal / rest adequately right before the hike. Build your fitness level before the trip. If you’re sedentary and/or overweight, be kind to yourself and start from Kurama instead.

P.S: I’m in my early 40s,  moderately active/ exercise regularly.",no,,view review

Abbie Girl,2022-12-05 17:07:08,5,0,"Beautiful mountain shrine that you have to work to get to. Dogs are allowed on the path, but not the cable car. Even with the cable car, you still need to hike the remaining stairs. Those wanting to walk the entire way fave a fairly steel climb and then a series of switchbacks, but it makes a great dog walk. For humans, it's manageable if you take it as long walk. The views are amazing. At the top is the strongest power spot in Japan. Legend says that a god came from Venus over 6.5 million years ago and inhabited the mountain top, giving the Kurama temple it's power.",no,,view review
Yvonne Tong,2022-12-07 14:41:28,5,0,"This is by far my favourite Temple in Kyoto, mainly because I like how simple and quiet it is. It’s a Buddhist temple and you can really feel its sacredness and the importance of serene. Unlike other temples where they are very “commercialised” in selling their merchants, this temple is nothing close to that.

This is a place where I’ll visit again for hiking and worshiping in future when I return to Kyoto in other seasons!!

Took about an hour to hike from the Kifune shrine. Google maps 6 mins timing is inaccurate

d00d,2023-02-17 06:52:34,5,0,The buildup to it and the temple itself is very special and one of the most memorable places in Japan for me. I really recommend walking from Kurama station to it and then continue walking to Jinja Shrine,no,,view review

Rtexal Tan,2023-03-19 07:54:12,5,0,"A fantastic temple that should be combined with a trip to Kifune as this temple has much more to visit. It is a large site with a lower shrine and upper shrine (accessible via a trail or with cable car - last train at 16:20 upwards and 16:25 downwards).

Recommended to walk on the trail connecting Kurama temple to Kifune shrine. We even saw a deer up close closer to the evening.

JJ,2023-04-05 03:42:30,5,1,"When I visited, it was snowing, which added to the enchanting atmosphere of the temple.

To reach the temple, you can take a cable car or climb up the hill. Unfortunately, when I visited, the cable car was broken down, so we had to climb up. While it was slippery and tiring (we slipped on the snow so many times!), the journey was fun and the view was worth it.

This temple is by far the most serene temple I’ve been. Really quiet and with a spectacular view. Gives off a really tranquil view.

karthik sivaraman,2023-04-24 05:57:55,5,0,"I visited this place on foot from a station 20 mins away from the temple(Google was wrong). It was a rainy day and added charm to the place. There was hardly any crowd at the time of my visit. Even though I had missed the Sakura in Kansai region, I was lucky enough to witness blooms on the courtyard of the temple. There are some temples where you feel the spiritual energy, and this was one of them for me. The location and  the main sanctuary of the temple were appealing and I would definitely rate it high among the temples I visited in Kyoto region.",no,,view review

You can also take the mount kurama cable car for the hop on and off if you don't want to hike. I went there in winter and it was so beautiful, especially the cable car descent with all white views from the cable car.
