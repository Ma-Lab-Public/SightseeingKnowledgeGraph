„Åæ„Å£„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì,2019-10-06 09:50:02,3,4," Speaking of prayers for safe childbirth in Kyoto, this is Wara Tenjin. If you pray for safe childbirth, you will be given a bellyband and amulet, but they will also come with straw stamens. If the straw has a knot, it is a boy. If there is no knot, it is called a girl. It has a reputation for having a high hit rate, but in the case of my family, it was a boy, although it was ""no knot"" both times. It may be because I groaned, ""Eh! I wish I had a boy!"" The older child doesn't know that such a thing has happened, and is currently cycling to school in front of Straw Tenjin.

Pregnant women would take the fallen straw home with them, and later cut it off and give it as a talisman for safe childbirth.

Maboo Nakano,2022-11-12 09:06:02,4,0," I visited for the first time in several years. Konohanasakuya Hime no Mikoto is enshrined at the Waratenjin shrine, which is right next to the bus stop at Waratenjin. It is said that the sex of the straw can be determined by whether it has knots or not, and is commonly known as Wara Tenjin. It's usually not crowded, but on the 9th of every month and on the day of the dog, Ubumochi is sold on business trips and it's crowded.
In the early 9th century, Waratenjin was enshrined in Tenjinoka, northwest of Kinkaku-ji Temple, as the god of Kitayama, but Yoshimitsu Ashikaga relocated it to its present location, and although there have been many twists and turns, it seems to have continued to this day.

Satoshi 467,2022-12-18 10:27:36,5,0," Main enshrined deity: Konohanasakuya Hime no Mikoto
Enshrined deity: Amanehiwashi no Mikoto/Kikuhata Senchihime no Mikoto

Founding is unknown. It is believed to be the god of safe childbirth, and it is commonly called 'Wara Tenjin' because straw is bestowed as a lucky charm for safe childbirth.

Originally, Tenjinjigi, who descended to Kinugasa Village, Kadono County, Yamashiro Province as the god of Kitayama, was enshrined in the land of Kitayama. The person who did this enshrined the god of Sugo Ishibu Shrine (Site Tenjin) that he had revered, enshrined it next to Kitayama no Kami, and also enshrined Konohanasakuyahime no Mikoto, the mother of Sugo Ishibu no Kami, as the main enshrined deity. .

In 1397, when Yoshimitsu Ashikaga built the current Kinkakuji, it became inconvenient to visit, so both shrines were enshrined together and moved to the current location.

Worship: 2022/12/18
