Á¥∫Á¢ßËñÑÁ¥Ö,2020-11-15 01:12:40,5,4," It is a shrine with an elegant atmosphere that makes you feel as if a nobleman appears. When I heard about the vengeful spirit of Emperor Sutoku on TV, I thought it was a scary place. What is the height of expansion?

However, even after hundreds of years, it seems that the strong feelings that made him called the vengeful spirit of Emperor Sutoku remained. Emperor Sutoku is counted as one of Japan's three greatest vengeful spirits, but unlike the other two who were philosophical, it seemed that he still had the feeling of wanting to clear his regrets and not giving up. His dignity was exceptionally the best, and he was so dignified that he was called the emperor.

The amulets of Shiramine Jingu also contain the strong power of Emperor Sutoku, so it gives the impression that ordinary evil spirits will be astonished and flee. I was worried about the red bill and the yellow bill. My impression is that a red amulet should be used to cut off a strong bad relationship that cannot be helped, and a yellow amulet should be used for a weak bad relationship that is likely to turn into a good one.

The bills you receive also have weight. Since it is a bill, it is as thin as a piece of paper, but the weight of the air around it is amazing. The presence of the talisman is amazing. Never forget that you have a bill. Once you put the talisman on, the stagnant air with poor airflow that worries you about renting is gone.

It's a big bell at the time of worship, but this is also amazing. I had an image that my wish would come true when I rang it. It is a mysterious bell, so it is recommended to ring it when visiting the shrine.

The enshrined deities are the 75th Emperor Sutoku and the 47th Emperor Junnin. Speaking of Emperor Sutoku (Sutokuin), the disaster caused by his power was so powerful that he was counted as one of Japan's three great vengeful spirits (Sugawara no Michizane, Taira no Masakado, and Sutokuin).
On August 18th, 4th year of Keio, Emperor Meiji sent an imperial messenger to Sanuki to conduct the ceremony of his enthronement, so that the spirit of Emperor Sutoku could return to Kyoto and Shiramine Jingu Shrine was built here. The reason why Emperor Junnin is enshrined is because he was also exiled 400 years ago from Sutoku-in Temple.
Around here, near Horikawa Imadegawa, Seimei Shrine, Ichijo Modoribashi, and other unique places in Kyoto, I am very attracted.
I feel that there is an indescribable atmosphere in this modern age.
Another reason why Shiramine Jingu Shrine is famous is that the Seidai Daimyojin Shrine, a subsidiary shrine, protects the improvement of sports and arts, so many people, such as the Japanese soccer team, visit the shrine. and we can see it.

Cu is kicking, Ju is ball. Cuju means to play football.
It was first introduced from China as the training of samurai.
It later became an athletics game in Japan, a nobleman's game, and a ritual today.

On April 14 every year, it is a spring ceremony in honor of Emperor Junnin
Held at the Asuka family, which has been the main family of cuju since ancient times, at today's Shiramine Shrine.

Early in the morning, many people were already waiting in front of the open space next to the shrine, and some of them watched the ceremony in front of the shrine.
After the priestess performed the ceremony with a dagger dance, the priests awarded honors to the gentlemen in formal attire, and finally took out the sacrificial items from the high room.
Then, Cuju officially began.

After the referee placed the ball in the center of the open space, the players squatted around the ball one by one, and after paying homage to the emperor, they began to kick the ball.
