紺碧薄紅,2020-11-15 01:12:40,5,4," It is a shrine with an elegant atmosphere that makes you feel as if a nobleman appears. When I heard about the vengeful spirit of Emperor Sutoku on TV, I thought it was a scary place. What is the height of expansion?

However, even after hundreds of years, it seems that the strong feelings that made him called the vengeful spirit of Emperor Sutoku remained. Emperor Sutoku is counted as one of Japan's three greatest vengeful spirits, but unlike the other two who were philosophical, it seemed that he still had the feeling of wanting to clear his regrets and not giving up. His dignity was exceptionally the best, and he was so dignified that he was called the emperor.

The amulets of Shiramine Jingu also contain the strong power of Emperor Sutoku, so it gives the impression that ordinary evil spirits will be astonished and flee. I was worried about the red bill and the yellow bill. My impression is that a red amulet should be used to cut off a strong bad relationship that cannot be helped, and a yellow amulet should be used for a weak bad relationship that is likely to turn into a good one.

The bills you receive also have weight. Since it is a bill, it is as thin as a piece of paper, but the weight of the air around it is amazing. The presence of the talisman is amazing. Never forget that you have a bill. Once you put the talisman on, the stagnant air with poor airflow that worries you about renting is gone.

It's a big bell at the time of worship, but this is also amazing. I had an image that my wish would come true when I rang it. It is a mysterious bell, so it is recommended to ring it when visiting the shrine.

The enshrined deities are the 75th Emperor Sutoku and the 47th Emperor Junnin. Speaking of Emperor Sutoku (Sutokuin), the disaster caused by his power was so powerful that he was counted as one of Japan's three great vengeful spirits (Sugawara no Michizane, Taira no Masakado, and Sutokuin).
On August 18th, 4th year of Keio, Emperor Meiji sent an imperial messenger to Sanuki to conduct the ceremony of his enthronement, so that the spirit of Emperor Sutoku could return to Kyoto and Shiramine Jingu Shrine was built here. The reason why Emperor Junnin is enshrined is because he was also exiled 400 years ago from Sutoku-in Temple.
Around here, near Horikawa Imadegawa, Seimei Shrine, Ichijo Modoribashi, and other unique places in Kyoto, I am very attracted.
I feel that there is an indescribable atmosphere in this modern age.
Another reason why Shiramine Jingu Shrine is famous is that the Seidai Daimyojin Shrine, a subsidiary shrine, protects the improvement of sports and arts, so many people, such as the Japanese soccer team, visit the shrine. and we can see it.

This area used to be the residence of the Asukai family, the masters of Kemari and Waka poetry.
In 1868, Emperor Meiji moved the spirit of Emperor Sutoku to this place and built it.
Later, the spirit of Emperor Junnin was also enshrined.
Both Emperor Sutoku and Emperor Junnin were driven out of the capital and died in exile.
They were enshrined at Shiramine Jingu Shrine to comfort their spirits and obtain divine protection.

The subordinate shrine and landlord shrine enshrine Seidaimyojin, the god of Kemari. In recent years, it has been worshiped as the god of sports improvement.
In addition, since kemari does not drop the ball, it is believed to be the god of passing exams and improving academic ability.
