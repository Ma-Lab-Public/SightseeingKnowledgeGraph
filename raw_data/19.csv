You have to leave your shoes or sleepers at entrance and wear the sandals given by temple authority.
There is a character writing class in the temple which you can experience for  ￥1000.
They have restrooms for men and women inside also for emergencies.
There is a beautiful lake beside the temple where you can relax a bit before moving on to different spot.
There is a bus stop in front of temple where you can catch the bus to reach an JR station. Only bus number 91 runs on this route. I feel it is like an residential area. I couldn't find any restaurant or eatery shop surrounding the temple .

Although it is far from the center of Arashiyama, it is a short walk from the bus stop, and there are relatively few tourists, so you can take your time to see it.

The ""Garyu no Matsu"" in front of the reception was wonderful.
It spread like a cloud, yet it was carefully maintained and the green was vivid.
The combination of ""Garyu no Matsu"" and ""Shikidai Genkan"" was wonderful❤️

""Daikakuji"" is recommended for those who like looking at paintings.
The paintings on the sliding doors of the Shinden had gorgeous flowers and birds on a golden background.
Birds flew among the flowers, and the chicks of the birds were also drawn.

In addition, ""Yasuido"" is an irresistible building for those who like paintings, such as ceiling paintings with tools such as flowers and musical instruments, clouds and dragons, celestial lions, and lions with stupid faces.

I went to see the lotus at Osawa Pond, but it hadn't bloomed at all yet. The lotus here blooms late every year, and I was told that the best time to see them is around the time of Obon.

I can't help it, so I only saw the temple area. The entrance fee is 500 yen. The Osawa pond area is 300 yen, and you can also see only the pond. The parking lot is 500 yen for 2 hours.

It is the head temple of the Daikakuji school of Shingon Buddhism, and its principal image is Fudo Myo-o. It was originally built as the 'Rikyu Saga-in' of Emperor Saga, but it was opened as a temple in 876.

Highlights include fusuma paintings by Kano Sanraku, Murasame's corridor (a type of security device), and Osawa Pond seen from the Kangetsudai of Godaido (main hall). It is better to have 1 hour just for the temple area, and 2 hours if you want to see the Osawaike area as well.

The temple area and Osawa Pond are separate for viewing. There are many buildings in the hall area, and you can walk along the corridors, but the structure is complicated, so it might be better to keep the layout in mind by looking at the map.

The best view of the garden is Shinden and Miedo. In the center of the garden, there is a stage-like structure called Ishibutai, and temples are lined up around it. On the day I visited, the area around the hall was decorated with colorful chrysanthemum flowers, adding color.
Many of the fusuma paintings in the hall are open to the public, so it would be fun to walk around and look at them.

Godaido, which is the main hall, is the last one on the tour route. The view of Osawa Pond is good from the stage that extends from here, and if you want to see Osawa Pond, you have to go down to the pond from here.

Away from the terrible crowds near Arashiyama Togetsukyo Bridge, you can enjoy the beautiful scenery leisurely during the maple viewing season. In addition to the maple leaves, there are also many beautiful chrysanthemums to enjoy. The buildings with the background, the distant mountain scenery and the sky are really intoxicating. .

After visiting the main hall area, you must go for a walk in Daze Pond. If the water is calm, you can still see the beautiful reflection.

The area is so wide that I couldn't see everything, but I think it's a place where you can enjoy the goshuin, which is seasonal. This is the second temple I've been to so far, but you can purchase amulets with electronic money. Also, unlike the Arashiyama area, it is a famous place, but perhaps because it is far away, there are fewer people, which is a relief. I think it's a wedding, but I saw two pairs.

Layafille V,2022-12-24 04:17:47,5,4," Osawa Pond is particularly beautiful during the red leaf season. There are not many maple trees, but they are dotted around the beautiful Osawa Pond. It looks picturesque and surrounded by mountains, which is natural and peaceful. It is a little far away from the lively area of ​​Arashiyama, but there are buses 28 and 94 opposite the Arashi Power Station that can go directly to the gate of the temple. There are not many people when visiting. Take a walk around the pool slowly. The atmosphere is leisurely and calm. Two or three o'clock in the afternoon After that, the light gradually turned into the oblique reflection of the setting sun, reflecting on the water surface, shining golden lights like starbursts. You can copy the scriptures in the temple, there are several kinds of scriptures to choose from, such as the Heart Sutra, and there are also various elegant embroidery decorations of the Royal Zhuyin, which makes people love it. There are also a variety of temple-themed stationery, daily necessities, snacks, and incense products in the souvenir shop, all of which are high-quality products. It is a place where you can slow down, copy scriptures, shop, take a walk, enjoy the scenery, and enjoy a whole afternoon.

chan やっ (Y-Chan),2022-12-31 05:53:22,5,1," We visited on a Kyoto bus tour.
When I heard that the temple was used for the filming of historical dramas and the PV of a certain famous singer, my image of the temple changed and I felt closer to it.
I was able to enjoy the precious scenery because I was draining the pond.

Y R,2023-01-29 01:19:28,5,4," It takes 17-18 minutes on foot from JR Arashiyama Station, and over 20 minutes from Randen Arashiyama Station.
Parking is 500 for 2 hours. There are only 30 parking lots, so if they are full, you will have to use a nearby parking lot.
Entrance fee is 500 yen for adults (regular)
There is an additional charge for admission to the Special Treasure Exhibition.
Built in the Heian period, this temple is often used as a filming location for period dramas.
After entering the entrance, cross the elegant Goten River and proceed straight to reach the Akechimon Gate.
that? I thought I'd seen it somewhere before, but then the Minamimachi magistrate's office from the Hissatsu series lol
If you go through the front gate and go to the back, you will find the Shikidai entrance.
After that, we went around Shinden, Murasame no Corridor (Uguisuhari Corridor), Seishinden, Miei-do, Chokufushinkyo-den, Yasuido, Godaido (main hall), and headed towards Osawa Pond. The painting on the fusuma with peonies was a masterpiece of beauty.
Also, on this day, the normally closed Seishinden was open to the public. Not only the fusuma painting, but also the cute rabbit painting on the shoji waistboard ❤️
About an hour so far.
Osawa Pond can be walked around, but this time I gave up due to time constraints💦
It was a pond so big that I couldn't believe it was made artificially.

The imperial palace of Emperor Saga, who was born in 786, later became a temple.

Daikakuji Temple has a deep relationship with the imperial family, so it is said to be a highly prestigious temple ☺️☺️

At the entrance of Daikakuji Temple, there was a large flower arrangement of Saga Goryu.

Is this the birthplace!?

The paintings on the fusuma and folding screens were also wonderful! ️

Although it was the cold season, the temple and precincts were quiet ( ^ω^ )

There were people who were copying sutras!! ️

The quiet and dignified atmosphere was tense ☺️☺️

Maybe it's the handle of the lattice door ❓,,, there's a cute golden cicada 😊😊😊

Cameras are prohibited for Buddha statues and related tools, but other than that, I was able to shoot with my smartphone❣️

When I was walking in the wide corridor of the temple, I seriously misunderstood for a moment that it was the Uguisu corridor of Nijo Castle, but it was the sound of my slippers walking...it was really quiet (^ω^)

I walked from Saga-Arashiyama Station, but it took me about 15 minutes or less because there was only a slight slope.

I was a little hesitant at first, but after visiting both Daikakuji Temple and Osawa Pond, I was really pleased 😄😄😄

箕輪明（業平君）,2023-03-06 12:16:40,5,2," Is it the largest temple in Sagano? Tenryu-ji is also nice, but Daikaku-ji is a valuable building where you can see the style of the Imperial Palace. A door that opens up and down is called a ``shitomi'' in the classics, and you can see it. I remember Ukon's Tachibana and Sakon's cherry blossoms, but at this Daikaku-ji Temple, it was Sakon's plum. The view of Osawa Pond from Godaido is wonderful. Unlike the old days, Osawa Pond is also charged. I was surprised. While remembering the past, we toured the lakeside and visited the ruins of Nagoso Falls. I can't help but hum Fujiwara Kinto's waka. ""It's been a long time since the sound of the waterfall stopped, but the name is still flowing and you can still hear it."" The weather was good and it was a comfortable visit. thank you very much.

Konog,2023-03-16 01:46:03,5,0," Buses often come from Yamagoe and Arashiyama, so transportation access is good.
It is also easy to go to Hirosawa Pond and Okusaga by bicycle.

The precincts are centered around Osawa Pond, with cherry blossoms in spring and autumn leaves in autumn.
You should take a picture when you go there.

In addition, the palace has fusuma paintings, architecture from the Heian period, and a sense of life.

In addition, the ruins of Nagoso Falls and haiku written by haiku poets exist in the precincts, and I can imagine that people have been looking at the same scenery since ancient times.

Ayaka Kamaru,2023-03-19 12:35:59,3,0,This temple is wonderful and I recommend anyone to visit it BUT you have to pay fees (500Y) for temple entrance then fees (300Y) to be able to walk in the park ...! Why not doing only one ticket entrance fee...,no,,view review
Lee Amy,2023-03-30 23:06:49,4,0,"Recommended for those who want a more peaceful temple yet with great structure. Entrance fee is 500¥.  Once you re done, you may topup 300¥ to proceed to Osawa pond which is right beside the temple.

킴민우,2023-05-17 06:05:15,5,1,"Wonderful place! If you‘re in the area and want to visit a temple, come here. No visitors while the other temples were absolutely crowded.

The temple is beautiful and the surroundings with the japanese garden and the adjacent pond and garden are breathtaking.

Best temple I have visited and an absolutely magnificent experience",no,,view review
あまとうですけどなにか?,2023-05-28 22:01:05,5,1," After going to Arashiyama, I visited the shrine.
There is a large parking lot in front of the temple.
When I entered the gate, the pine trees spread all over and the garden like a sea of ​​clouds was splendid.
In contrast to the lively atmosphere of Arashiyama, I was able to spend a peaceful time wrapped in silence.
The weather was good, so the scenery was very beautiful and my heart was washed.
In each hall, you can copy sutras,
I was allowed to brush on the sand,
It was impressive that everyone was spending their time slowly.
Several pre-wedding shoots were also held.
