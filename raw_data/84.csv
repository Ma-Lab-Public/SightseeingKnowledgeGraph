When I looked at the map, I suddenly became interested in this place.

When I arrived, I was irritated because the car was forced to pass on a narrow uphill. Then come to the entrance and hah! will do. Everything was looked straight at the principal image.
Embarrassing.

I paid 500 yen to meet the Kannon inside.
A half-hearted presence when facing to the right.
I was wondering if I should go to my knees. i wanna go.
I thought I was going to buy a bill, so I sat down on Kannon's lap.

Then strangely
Just as I was about to put in the money, I leaned forward and it felt like Kannon was stroking my head. üò≥
Since it's 300 yen, I don't think I noticed it at the speed of putting in 3 100-yen coins.
Until now, I was embarrassed and shy in front of Kannon, but I cried.
Normally, it is rare to see Kannon from such a close distance. Even if you put 10,000 yen in it, you won't regret it.

After being comforted by Kannon for a while, I realized my essence this time. Because I didn't trust him.
Over and over again I was canceled at the last minute and became distrustful.
I can no longer trust people.
It seems that I just paid for it, and there was no one around,
It was good just to realize that.
That's what you're saying.

By the way, you can meditate on the tatami mats in the garden.
just take a deep breath
Serotonin and oxytocin are released perfectly.
After that, I went to Ujigami Shrine, but it didn't fit. I definitely recommend this temple. and go alone.
I think it's okay to go with friends or for sightseeing, but it's hard to get to the best places.

yuki,2022-05-23 00:34:42,4,1," Since it is far from the station, there are few tourists, so you can relax very much.
The atmosphere is also good, it is a very nice and cozy temple.
Personally, I really like the three-faced Daikokuten on the left side of the main hall. She has a soft, gentle and playful face, and just looking at her makes me feel relaxed.

ÊùæÊæ§ÈõÖ‰∏Ä,2022-10-14 07:59:11,4,1," It is a temple descended from the first temple built in Japan's Soto sect.
At first, it was in Fukakusa, Fushimi, but the Soto sect at that time could not withstand the impeachment from the new religion and existing sects in the Kamakura period, so it was closed.
It was rebuilt at its current location.

The uphill that continues from the first gate is a famous place for autumn leaves, and it extends straight.
When you go up the slope, there is another temple gate and you will be in the precincts.
There is an automatic ticket vending machine that sells admission fees and goshuin stamps in front of the temple gate (anti-infection measures?).

If you walk straight, there is a corridor and there is a notice board to go to the right.
Take off your shoes (slippers are provided) and go to the reception.
At the reception, check the ticket issued by the ticket vending machine (if you want to receive a goshuin, leave the goshuin book).
First of all, you will be urged to the main hall.
The ceiling is a bloody ceiling.
It's the floorboards of Fushimi Castle when it fell.
One aspect of the training dojo is similar to Eiheiji Temple in Fukui, which is the Soto sect.

The nearest station is Uji Station, but if you come from Kyoto Station, take JR.
If you are coming from the city areas of Osaka or Kyoto, is it Keihan?
Directions from the Keihan station are easier to understand.
Cross the pedestrian crossing in front of the station and walk along the Uji River in the direction of Ujigami Shrine. After passing Ujigami Shrine, walk for about 5 minutes and you will see the Sakashita Gate.

The staff at the tourist information center at Keihan Uji Station told me that Koshoji Temple is one of the power spots, so I decided to ask!

After enjoying Byodo-in Temple, head to Koshoji Temple along the Uji River under the clear autumn sky.
On the way to Kotozaka, I was overwhelmed by the powerful flow of water flowing into the Uji River from a tributary of the Kanryu Bridge.

The main hall has a bloody ceiling that is said to have been relocated from Fushimi Castle, and you can clearly see the handprints and footprints.
It's quite far from the city center, so it's a quiet and solemn atmosphere, a relaxing place. I definitely felt like I had power.

From the unique temple gate to the dharma hall, Tenjikuden, and Daishoin, it has a truly atmospheric appearance. There is also a digital system in the ancient culture, and you can spend a good time. The image expanded just by looking at the zazen room.

ÂàùËä±„Åï„Å™„Åà,2022-11-26 13:22:39,4,3," This temple is famous for the autumn leaves of Kotozaka.
It has the same name as the first temple of the Japanese Soto sect, with more than 14,000 temples, the largest number of temples in Japan as a single religious temple. This is the branch temple of Eiheiji Temple, which was rebuilt as a family temple by Naomasa Nagai, the lord of the Yodo domain, by relocating the building of Fushimi Castle.

There is a parking lot in front of the mountain gate that climbed Kotozaka, and during the season, pedestrians were given priority and traffic was restricted, so please be aware that you will be walking at other tourist spots and using paid parking lots along the way.

Fujiwara culture such as Byodo-in Temple and Ujigami Shrine and ""Zazen"" may be too different.

Yuchuva,2022-12-20 16:31:10,4,0," I visited twice during the fall foliage season.
Koshoji Temple is famous for Kotozaka, and the tunnel of bright red autumn leaves is beautiful.
Since it is the first dojo of Zen and Soto sects to open, events such as monthly zazen sessions are actively held.

Vending machines can be used to buy worship tickets, but discount coupons are sometimes distributed at restaurants around Uji, so if you want to use them, you need to go to the indoor reception.

The highlights are the statue of Sho Kannon, also known as Tenarai Kannon, and the three-faced Daikokuten, which is Hideyoshi's principal deity to protect his success in life. There is also a place where you can relax and enjoy the view of the garden, so it is recommended for a leisurely trip.

Akino Shiori,2022-12-28 02:44:06,5,0," From the Ryumon along the Uji River, go up Kotozaka, an approach known for its autumn leaves, to reach the Sanmon. The area around the temple is surrounded by a fence, and many temples are built in the precincts. It is Dogen Zenji's first dojo and the oldest training dojo of the Soto sect. Currently, the general public is also accepting experiences of Zen meditation and sutra copying. The temples are connected by a corridor, so you can visit them in a round trip. In the center of the precincts, there is a large, well-maintained garden with pine trees and pagodas. There were few people visiting and I was able to visit slowly.

There was a three-faced Daikokuten.

Ben Hsu,2023-04-26 05:20:04,5,0,"Koushouji Temple in Uji has been traditionally translated as ""Koshoji"" Temple in English, although the Temple itself uses Koushouji Temple for its web site and for its email communications.

While the Temple is a Buddhist Temple with history, the Temple is also famous for its funeral religious services to the decreased families. For the Temple itself, it has beautiful garden and gold-plated decorations hanging from ceilings of the main worship hall.

Koushouji Temple is suitable for the visitors, who visit Byodoin Temple in the same Uji area, for the short walking distance, although on the opposite side of the Uji River.
