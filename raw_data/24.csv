The statue of Miroku Bodhisattva, which is the first National Treasure, is very famous. Even if you try to know more about it, you will be wrapped in a vague feeling. I don't think it makes sense to stick to the history of this Buddha. I don't think there is any other statue of Buddha with such dignity, and the fact that it has been so deeply revered by so many people for 1,400 years is enough.
Speaking of Koryu-ji Temple, it may be said that the Niomon Gate, which can be seen from Randen, is the most familiar. The front of the gate that feels like a commoner, the precincts that make you feel the Asuka period, and the Prince's faith. Although it is small, it is a temple with endless charm.

Unlike ordinary Buddha statues, it has a firm and toned body, giving the illusion that it is about to start moving and talk to you. Kobo Daishi Kukai seems to be one of the fascinated! Wooden statues of Prince Shotoku aged 2 and 16 are also enshrined, and there is a deep connection with related temples throughout the country, such as Tachibana-dera Temple in Asuka Village, Nara, where he was born. Please also see the wooden statues of Mr. and Mrs. Masaru Hatakawa, who were the most influential people in talking about Heiankyo! Matsuo-taisha, Kamigamo-jinja, Shimogamo-jinja, Kijima-jinja with the crest of Futaba Aoi, and Fushimi Inari-taisha, the head shrine of Inari, were probably founded by Mr. Hata who was a visitor! There are many traces of the Japan-U.S. same-ancestor theory.

Jituei Kobashi,2019-04-10 07:58:01,2,18," It was a visit that made me understand why this temple is rarely featured in various tourist information and media.
Nandaimon, which faces the road where Randen runs, feels very close to people, and I thought it was very good. When I passed through the south gate and saw the spacious precincts of the temple, I felt as if I had come to an old temple in Nara.
Unfortunately, the connections between the cathedrals were bad, so I couldn't go inside, and the explanation wasn't enough, so I gradually lost the desire to go to the next cathedral.
I paid the admission fee for the first time when I entered the Reihoden, where Maitreya Bodhisattva is enshrined. I was rudely told to take off my woolen hat, which is a must-have for a person with no hair on my head.
It's also a place of prayer, but if you charge an admission fee, you need to consider (heating) the visitors!
From the people in charge in the hall, I felt the movements and gazes as if they were watching the visitors! I'm sorry, but I felt bad.
I felt that I should study more about how to deal with visitors, including the ticket office.
I understand why it is rarely featured in the media even though it is one of the oldest temples in Japan.

(2019.03.29)

The individual has many purposes in this trip,
One of them is to come to Taiqin and National Treasure No. 1
""Maitreya Bodhisattva half-heeled thinking image"" to meet.

It's as if the Bodhisattva was saying, ""It's time"",
A beautiful picture is posted in front of the Guanglong Temple
The Maitreya Bodhisattva photo greeted us with a smiling face.

When I was happy, I didn't expect to turn up the stairs but I saw
Two wide-eyed vajra warriors stared at me,
As if saying: ""Boy, I've been waiting for you for a long time!""
Let me restrain my excitement a little and enter the temple :P

The cherry blossoms in the temple were in bloom on this day, but there were not many tourists.
We bought tickets for worship and entered the Lingbao Hall.
Since I can't take pictures here, I can only say:

After entering the treasure hall, the first thing you will see on the left is the magnificent
""Twelve Generals"", Sunlight, Moonlight Bodhisattva
And the unopened secret Buddha Yakushi Tathagata.
This part alone has left me dumbfounded.
As I admired it, I thought to myself:
""No wonder Japan is so strong in modeling technology"" XD

After reading the Twelve Gods, I turned my attention to National Treasure No. 1.
I meditated here for a while, like thinking,
Then the Bodhisattva told me an important thing here:

""Hey, nothing is impossible,
Our troubles are as small as the sand of the Ganges,
Leave it to Him to think and lay down the burden here. ""

Â••ÊùëÊÖé‰πüÔºàOK computerÔºâ,2019-05-21 14:23:32,4,1," Koryu-ji Temple is located in Uzumasa, which is famous for Toei Kyoto Studio Park, but it is unknown whether it was originally located in this area. It is widely believed that the temple was moved to its present location before or after the relocation of the capital. At the time of its foundation, the principal image of worship was Miroku Bosatsu, but around the time the capital was moved to Heian, it became a temple with Yakushi Nyorai as its principal image, and became a temple centered on the belief in Yakushi and Prince Shotoku. The principal image of Jogu Oin, which is the main hall of Koryu-ji Temple today, is a statue of Prince Shotoku. ""Jogu Shotoku Hoo Teisetsu"" lists Hachioka-ji Temple (Koryu-ji Temple) as one of the 'Seven Great Temples Built by the Prince'.
There are descriptions about the founding of Koryu-ji Temple in ""Nihonshoki"" (Chronicles of Japan), etc., and it is certain that it was the temple of the Hata clan, but since the old records were lost due to the fire in 818, the early history of the temple is lost. is not always clear.
The Hata clan is said to be a naturalized Han Chinese who came from Qin (China) and came to Japan via the Korean Peninsula. Based in Kadono-gun (currently around the southern part of Ukyo Ward and Nishikyo Ward, Kyoto City), the family possessed techniques such as sericulture, weaving, sake brewing, and flood control. Kijimaza Amaterasu Mitama-jinja Shrine (silkworm shrine) near Koryu-ji Temple, Umenomiya Taisha Shrine in Umetsu, Ukyo Ward, and Matsuo Taisha Shrine in Arashiyama, Nishikyo Ward (both gods of sake brewing) are said to be shrines related to the Hata clan. Although there is Osake-jinja Shrine near Koryu-ji Temple, it was relocated from the precincts of Koryu-ji Temple to its current location due to the policy of separating Shintoism and Buddhism.

Of course, like Korea's national treasure, Japan's national treasure number is not determined by evaluating the value of the relic, but the meaning of No. 1 is unique. If it was also strongly influenced by Baekje, or it may (almost certainly) be produced in Baekje, then Japan's National Treasure No. 1 has a strong color from the Korean Peninsula. Self-esteem rises.
Unfortunately, the wooden Bangasayu statue was exhibited in a small museum like other cultural festivals, but the lighting in the exhibition room was too dark. This seems to be a characteristic of Japan, but almost all temples and places where Buddha is enshrined are all dark. Except for places like museums.
It's so dark that I can't really appreciate it. You can't even feel the grain of the wood or the traces of the years. It was disappointing as I had high expectations.

‰∏ÉÈù¢È≥•ÊîæÊµ™Ë®ò,2020-04-29 06:42:48,5,7," Todai-ji, Kofuku-ji, Horyu-ji, and a few other temples in Kyoto are the only temples in Kyoto that are comparable in terms of the quality of their Buddhist statues. Therefore, the evaluation is a comfortable five stars, but even though it is such a famous temple, it is plain. The worshipers are sparse and the parking lot is empty. The surrounding area is more of a residential area than a tourist spot, and there are far more people passing through the gate than passing through it, which makes me worry unnecessarily whether the management of the temple is okay. However, even if it is a residential area, access is convenient. Uzumasa Koryu-ji Station on the Arashiyama Electric Railway is just a stone's throw away from Romon Gate, and JR Uzumasa Station is within easy walking distance. Bus timetables are unreliable during the tourist season, so being close to the station is convenient. If you've been sightseeing around Arashiyama and still have time to catch the Shinkansen on your way home, don't hesitate to visit.
The Maitreya Bodhisattva statue, which is considered to be the first National Treasure, is a feast for the eyes just by looking at it, but we recommend that you fully enjoy it as much as time permits. There is also a bench in front of the statue, so it's okay if you're tired.

From this point, head west towards Isarai, and walk along the temple wall to the right along the temple gate. is a set of walks. It seems that these were separated from the precincts by Haibutsu Kishaku.

In Reihoden, there is a statue of a half-legged pensive that everyone knows. Located in the middle of a wide room, looking up. Unfortunately, the light is poor, and it's too far away, so I can't quite make out its expression. Therefore, I didn't feel much.
It took me half an hour to get my eyes adjusted to the darkness, and I watched it over and over again, but it just didn't work for me.
What caught my eye was the statue of Prince Shotoku sitting on a chair, which was good, and the Kawakatsu Hata and his wife, who were unskillful. 2 body. It's reminiscent of a seated figure, but it has no arms/legs... instead, a mirror is in front to hide its existence. Am I the only one who finds this unnatural?
I was glued to the statue of Kawakatsu. It's the first time I've seen a statue with such sharp eyes that widen my eyes...the eyes are stronger than the statue of Fudo Myoo.

The statue is made of Japanese red pine from the Korean Peninsula, and it is unknown whether it was an imported Buddha or carved in Japan, but Koreans are proud that Japan's first national treasure was made on the Korean Peninsula. And
The auditorium is currently undergoing restoration work, perhaps due to the effects of a typhoon, while the seated statue of Amida Nyorai (a national treasure) remains in the hall, and is expected to be completed in a few years.
