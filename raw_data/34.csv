ÂÜÜÂ∫ßÂéöÂè∏,2021-01-29 13:31:25,5,6," I visited in February 2017. I have been here many times. The place of worship is the Buddhist temple and the bathroom. It goes around with an explanation. The ceiling of the hall is painted by Kano Tanyu, and the bathroom is commonly known as the Akechi bath. In addition, I have visited the Kuri, the Kyozo, and the Sanmon, which were specially opened to the public. Also, on November 3rd and 4th every year, there is a Bouryo Exhibition, where many treasures are exhibited. I have only seen this once about 10 years ago. I think that there were more exhibits at this Bouryo exhibition than at the Myoshinji exhibition that was later held at the Kyoto National Museum. Myoshin-ji is said to have the largest number of branch temples among the Rinzai sect temples.
Since 2019, Myoshinji has changed its visit from the hall and bathroom to the hall and the kitchen. Prices are up. I visited in January 2020.

yo ‚ÄúTS2121‚Äù sakuro,2021-06-18 11:32:31,5,8," Visited on 6/13. Parking is free.

I stopped by during my trip to Kyoto to see the hydrangeas. There were no noticeable flowers in the precincts, but I saw a few hydrangeas in Taizoin. On the other hand, there were no worshipers looking for flowers, so I was able to take my time.

It is free if you just go around the precincts. The entrance fee for the Hatto and Okura is 700 yen. Taizo-in Temple is one of the sub-temples, but it has a splendid garden, and this alone is worthy of being a temple. There is an admission fee of 600 yen, but it is a must-see. Don't forget to listen to the sound of Suikinkutsu.

In the Hatto, you can see the cloud dragon painting on the ceiling. The guard said that it has never been restored since it was written in the Edo period.

Also, there are other temples with cloud dragon paintings, but most of them were written for sightseeing during the Showa era. That's why researchers and other experts said they highly value Myoshinji's Unryu-zu.

No one came in during the viewing, so I was able to monopolize it. It looks like an ascending dragon or a descending dragon depending on the direction you look at it. It seems that there was a long line before Corona, so if you want to take a closer look, now is your chance. Please note that photography is strictly prohibited.

There is a bell designated as a national treasure near the guard room (the bell on the front is the second one). It's cracked so it can't be played, but you can listen to the recording by pressing the button.

Myoshinji Temple, the head temple of the Myoshinji sect of the Rinzai sect, whose principal image is Shaka Nyorai.
I visited for the first time, but the site is wide anyway. Most of them can be seen for free, but an admission fee is required for the main hall, which houses Tanyu Kano's painting of clouds and dragons, and the Okuuri, which is the kitchen of the temple.
The painting of clouds and dragons was impressive and impressive, but the oldest temple bell in Japan (National Treasure 698), which is displayed in the same room, is the name of the world that was rung at the opening of NHK's New Year's Eve bell for a long time. You can listen to the CD sound source with the bell. It sounded really good!

ÂÆÖË¶ãËÇá,2021-08-12 00:55:33,5,18," A large temple with 100,000 tsubo (100,000 tsubo) grounds and seven temples of Zen Buddhism (seven buildings that a temple should have). Sengoku warlords also appear, and the highlights are full ‚úåÔ∏è
However, there are quite a lot of fees to visit and visit, and there are temples that are not usually open to tourists, so we recommend that you organize what you want to see before entering.

First, from the south gate, go straight on the stone-paved road to the dharma hall. Here, the ceiling painting of the Buddhist temple, ""Unryu-zu"" by Shinrei Kano. The eyes of the dragon seem to be glaring at you from any angle, so it is said to be the ""Dragon of All Directions"". Let's keep this in mind‚úãOkuri is the place where monks live. If you are not interested, you can just walk. (700 yen)

Taizo-in Temple, where there is a dry landscape garden, ""Motonobu's garden"" by the author, Kano Motonobu, and the Yin-yang garden and the pond spring style garden ""Yokoen"" are the highlights. Of course, the main hall also has a national treasure, Japan's oldest ink painting, and a picture of a sweetfish (Hyonenzu), which is also a must-see (500 yen)‚úã

Opened Daishin-in and Shoin as lodgings. Auntei in front of the study is a representative garden of the Showa period. The 400-year-old Kirishima azalea tree in the spring is double the appeal for matcha and sweets lovers sitting on the porch (300 yen)‚úã

Keishun-in was founded by the second son of Nobutada Oda. The four gardens are the Karesansui ""Shinjo no Niwa"", the beautiful moss-covered ""Shinyo no Niwa"", the ""Shinyo no Niwa"" with its beautiful moss, the ""Shii no Niwa"" that turns into a stone, and the ""Wai no Niwa"" that has stepping stones.

All of the above are open to the public all year round, so any time is OK. From here onwards, it is a recommended place for advance research such as special exhibitions. One is online delivery by monks. Recommended for executives of active members of society ‚úã
If you are a fan of the Sanada family (Masayuki, Nobuyuki), the second is Daihoin. The third one is Tenkyuin if you are interested in fusuma painting. 4 is for flower lovers, Chokei-in for those who like wisteria flowers, Torin-in for Sara Soju, who also appears in the Tale of the Heike.

The temple can be visited with a guide. It is recommended because you can also know the history.
The bell that was used for the first time in the next year is preserved in the Mido, which is the oldest in existence. Recommended for bell lovers.
Also, there are some KanColle elements. It is also recommended for admirals.
At the end of the guide, you will be guided to a place like a restaurant. Cooking utensils, cooking environments, food warehouses, etc. are left as they are, so it is also recommended for those who like history.

JACKPOT,2021-10-21 23:04:24,5,11," As expected, it is one of the largest temples in Kyoto.
Although only a limited number of them are open to the public at all times, I definitely recommend that you see Myoshin-ji Temple's Hojo and Hatto Hall, as well as Taizo-in Temple.
You will be overwhelmed by the presence of the large hallway of the Ohojo and the kitchen.
And above all, the ceiling painting of the Buddhist temple, Unryu-zu, is a splendid word. There are famous ones such as Kenninji and Shokokuji, but I wonder if the power is number one.
Unfortunately, photography is prohibited, but there is a reduced reproduction of a painting on the ceiling of the Okura.

Toshihiko Yano,2021-11-26 13:53:27,5,16," A large temple with many sub-temples. In addition to Myoshin-ji, Daitoku-ji and Tofuk-ji still have large temple complexes, but Myoshin-ji has the most volume.
For each sub-head, we defer to the individual comments of the sub-subhead.
In the Daihonzan area, the huge wooden buildings such as the Sanmon Gate are eye-catching, but it is fun to tour the gardens of the numerous sub-temples.
There are a variety of sub-temples, from those that are always open to the public to those that are not open to the public. I posted a photo showing only the garden of each sub-temple, but it is enough momentum to make a month-turning calendar with just this. And it's free. There aren't many places in Kyoto where you can enjoy things for free. Moreover, because it is off the circuit course around Arashiyama, Higashiyama, and Kinkakuji, it is vacant even on Saturdays and Sundays. It is the last oasis of sightseeing spots in Kyoto.
I emphasized that admission is free, but I would like to mention that the Japanese gardens at each sub-temple are all famous gardens. Taizo-in Temple is always open to the public and has a famous garden.

‰∏≠ÈáéË™†‰∫å,2022-11-29 11:57:42,5,7," It is a temple at the pinnacle of Zen Buddhism that represents Kyoto. I have visited several times and think it is a wonderful temple. This time, during the autumn leaves season, I had the opportunity to learn about the history of this temple while being guided by a monk. It is simple and simple like a Zen temple, but it is a good temple where you can feel the essence of Zen. Among them, the painting of a large dragon on the ceiling is very powerful, and you can take your time to admire it, so please take a look. As you walk along the earthen walls lined with sub-temples, feel the space and atmosphere where many monks trained. Special visits are often held, and there is a splendid accommodation facility called Hanazono Kaikan. Access from Kyoto Station by JR is not bad, so we strongly recommend visiting the temples in the vicinity of Arashiyama and Sagano.

Â±ÖÂ†¥ÂòâÊ¥•Ê≤ª,2022-12-02 10:36:20,4,6," Located in Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, this is the head temple of the Myoshinji branch of the Rinzai sect of Buddhism.
Among them, there is an important cultural property called ""Akechi-buro"".
It was built by Akechi Mitsuhide's uncle on his mother's side, a Buddhist monk of Omine-in Temple, to mourn for the soul of Akechi Mitsuhide.
Kasuga no Tsubone erected a bell to signal that the bath was ready, but it was destroyed by fire.
In 1587, five years after Mitsuhide's death, there is a theory that the reason why Mitsuhide was turned into a bathroom instead of a grave was to ""wash away the stigma of being a traitor who killed his lord Oda Nobunaga.""
The current one was rebuilt in 1656. Once inside, you can worship the statue of Bodhisattva, and in the waiting area behind it, the monks change into yukata ""yokue"" when taking a bath. It is said that this came to be called ""Yukata"" yukata. It was like a modern sauna, a steam bath where steam is generated by boiling water in a kettle.
After sweating, I washed my body in the wooden washing area, but only three buckets of hot water was allowed per person, so bathing was also part of my training. It was used until 1922.
It is written in ""Kanemi Kyoki"" written by Mitsuhide Akechi and Kanemi Yoshida, who was good in the middle, but Mitsuhide came to borrow the steam bath at Kanemi's house twice. Mitsuhide may have also liked baths.

To access, get off at Hanazono on the JR Sagano Line and walk for 5 minutes. From Kyoto Station, take the city bus No. 26 for 25 minutes and get off at Myoshinji Kitamon-mae.

eye diamond,2023-01-10 07:49:22,5,2," The ceiling painting of clouds and dragons at Myoshinji Temple, the head temple of the Rinzai sect of Buddhism, is truly wonderfulüíï
There are other paintings of clouds and dragons on the ceiling, but this ""Happo glaring dragon"" drawn by Tanyu Kano seems to be in a different position from the ascending dragon and the descending dragon, depending on the direction you look at it, and the guide told me that it was a technique using triangular perspective. He gave me ‚ù£Ô∏è, so I went round and round 3 times and looked at it from various places, but the more I looked at it, the more impressed I was with how amazing it was drawn!!

I wonder if the old temples were like this?
Putting that aside, Kyoto is still good‚ù§.
Well, even for sightseeing, getting lost at night can be difficult. It's easier if it's close to a big street where buses pass, but even if you can go near a tourist spot, can't you go home easily? Even more so if the surrounding scenery is similar. It is recommended that you draw a large ""Fukan"" around the area on the map.
(You can pass through Myoshin-ji Temple from the Randen Myoshin-ji Station side to the JR Hanazono Station side as a community road. I don't know the closing time, but in the evening there are many parents and children picking up the temple's kindergarten. Quiet. Let's go to.There are many people who come by bicycle, so it's quite a thrill.)

When I happened to be on the bus, I heard something about it, so I got off the bus.

There was no homework, so everything I saw was fresh.

It seems to be a system where you pay to visit the main shrine and other facilities, but just looking at the free grounds will fill you up.
In other words, I was satisfied enough just by looking at it from the outside.
I think the splendor of the architectural structure is something that we can be proud of to the world.
Of course, I could see people going inside and copying sutras, so if you like that kind of thing, I think it's good to do it.

Thank you‚ò∫

There are not only buses, but also stations for both JR and Randen, and recently the number of parking lots has increased, so it is easy to access.
The precincts are often used in movies, so there may be places that feel familiar.
