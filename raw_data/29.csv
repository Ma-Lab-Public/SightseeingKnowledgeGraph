A special head temple of the Omuro sect of Shingon Buddhism. The principal object of worship is Gochi Fudoson.
Kinki 36 Fudoson No. 15 Sacred Site.

It is associated with the prayer Buddha of wisdom and the main image, and has a strong faith to protect academic performance.

◆Historical Chronology: Kobo Daishi (Kukai, 774-835), who returned from China in 806 during the Heian period, was located in Kitasaga, northwest of Hirosawa Pond (current Rengebuji Mausoleum of Emperor Gouda, the 91st Emperor of the Kamakura Period). It is said that Fudo Myo-o was carved into stone in the Iwaya. It is said that Daishi left behind the secret method of sealing cucumbers and became the founder of the mountain.

In 1057, Fujiwara no Yasumoto built Rengeji Temple, enshrining various statues of Amida, Kannon, etc., with this Kobo Daishi's Fudoson as the principal image. It is said that it was in the northwest of Hirosawa Pond. (Teraden)

Running towards the east side of Ninna-ji Temple in Kyoto... I've arrived at Gochiyama Renge-ji Temple. …Sake served on the inside

The summary of the goshuin is to run to the left side of the room inside the room.

On a special day on the other side of the temple, I'll be able to take a picture of the goddess ~ ~ I'm going to have a good time with some wooden cards ~(^_^)v

In 1057, at the imperial request of Emperor Goreizei, Yasumoto Fujiwara founded the temple near Hirosawa Pond, and eventually it became the inner shrine of Ninna-ji Temple. After that, it was destroyed by fire during the Onin War, and the temple was moved to the top of Mt.

In 1641, Tsunenobu (Higuchi Tairadayuietsugu), a wealthy merchant in Edo who was born in Ise Province, revived the temple and was approved by the Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakushin of Ninna-ji Temple to change the name of the temple to 'Gochisan Renge-ji.' . The Gochi Nyorai stone statues (Dainichi Nyorai, Amida Nyorai, Shaka Nyorai, Hosho Nyorai, and Yakushi Nyorai), whose figures can still be seen today, were also made by Tsuneshin at the request of Mokushokuso Tansho. It is a thing.

In 1928 (Showa 3), the temple was moved to its current location, which is adjacent to the east of Ninna-ji Temple. In 1958, the Gochi Nyorai stone statues and other scattered and damaged stone Buddhist statues left on Mt. Ondo were collected, restored, and enshrined in the precincts.
