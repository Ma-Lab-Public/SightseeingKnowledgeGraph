Last week I was given an opportunity to visit this school and it was such a marvelous experience. The school library is absolutely stunning with an unprecedentedly huge book reservation with books dating back to even 18th century, together with other departments of the libarary such as self-study area, entertainment area, discussion area, ect all equipped with modern technological paraphernalia. The school has an inhouse museum which looks good from the outside but unfortunately I could not visit and a bookstore which sells all kinds of books from constitutional laws, political economy to finance and magazines, including Forbes. The dormitory has many single rooms in which there are all necessary items a person need for a daily routine.  The canteen is clean and designed in such a way to promote privacy among individuals, foods are amazing. Classroom are large and lecturers are very inspiring though their English is not really good.

I guess it depends on how who rate the schools but as far as pure research output is concerned, I think Kyoto University is probably the best in the Basic Sciences while Tokyo University is better in the Liberal Arts, Engineering and maybe Mathematics.
I think the students are also very awesome and open-minded. The guys and girls I met at Kyoto University were all very nice and amiable to foreigners.

Comparison aside, a few labs of Kyoto University are leaders in their field. This is a good school, and perhaps the best for a few fields if you want to study and pursue a career in academia and are interested in living in Japan.

Risa,2020-09-24 02:30:58,4,44," I visited a friend at Kyoto University for the first time. My first impression was that it was a peaceful place, perhaps because there weren't many students due to the coronavirus. Is it in a place like this? I thought it would be closer to the station. There are many bicycles, and bicycles are the main means of transportation. Kyoto University is the second largest university in Japan, and is a world-famous university with many famous people. However, I hear that there are many people who are too free or strange. Cosplay is often talked about during the graduation ceremony season. For some reason, at Kyoto University, there is a custom of wearing a costume to attend the graduation ceremony, and it is said that it is quite flashy. I was envious of the number of libraries. It is said that there are 48 rooms and 7 million books, which is appreciated by students. I didn't go inside the building, but it was so peaceful that I could feel that student life at Kyoto University, surrounded by many world heritage sites, must be fun.

It's not the hospital's fault.

The other day, I had a conversation with the former NHK party leader and exposed the shame to the whole world. No, Nobuo Kawakami went to expose himself to shame. Nobuo Kawakami, flustered, repeatedly asked Mr. Takashi Tachibana the usual childish questions, showing off his low intelligence and lack of understanding. Even if it was a legal theory, this guy tried to get rid of the words and failed, and on the contrary, he was refuted. Nobuo Kawakami seems to take pride in his knowledge of the law, but his content is below amateur level, and it is unimaginable how bad it is.
It sounds long-winded, but his alma mater is Kyoto University. Since even such a low-intelligence person can graduate, if even elementary school students around here can't all enter with a little effort, it's a university at a level that doesn't make sense.

M KRN,2023-05-06 20:08:44,4,1," It was hot in the summer and winter, and I studied while wearing a coat in the winter. Nursing recently? The number of flashy students has increased, and the library is more crowded than before...
There is a 7-Eleven, so it's convenient, but the school cafeteria is cheaper, so I often use it even though it's far away. There is Tully's on campus.
When I bought Kyoto University goods for my relatives, they were delighted. My favorite is the Element Touch mug. The design seems to change from time to time. The jersey can also be used everyday (occasionally sold out)
The lady at the shop is kind enough to explain various things. There are various students and it is stimulating, but there are many bicycles and it is dangerous.

There was a medical school hospital a little far away.

There are many restaurants in the neighborhood that are popular with students, which will please your eyes. Kyoto is a city of students, and the atmosphere is appropriate for Japan's top academic institution.
