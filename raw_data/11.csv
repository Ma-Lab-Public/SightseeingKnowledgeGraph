Chastrya Sandi Dendang,2021-12-15 06:18:05,5,4,"To reach the top you need to walk or ‚Äúhike‚Äù around 20-40 minutes depending on your fitness level. Wear comfortable shoes and get to the top to see the monkeys. You can feed the monkeys from the cabin, purchase the food for 100 yen, entrance ticket is 550 yen. Don‚Äôt forget to read and follow the rules (don‚Äôt stare at them, don‚Äôt get too close and don‚Äôt crouch), I‚Äôve seen several tourist didn‚Äôt follow the rules and it could provoke the monkeys.

Everyone was panting and heaving when we got to the top but it was definitely worth it! There is a playground for children and 2 rest stops with fans. You are able to feed the monkeys from inside a human cage. The view is also amazing and very instagrammable. I'll definitely be back, but maybe with a bottle of water!

Sarah and Chris Elder,2022-08-07 13:27:06,5,8,"This was a memorable experience. The hike was worth the view and the experience of getting to interact with the monkeys.
There is a play ground for the Little‚Äôs to burn off extra energy if the home didn‚Äôt do that already. It has a slide and zip line.
You can buy monkey food there and it‚Äôs not too expensive and they use the money to keep the place running.
We visited in November and the weather was AWSOME!

However there‚Äôs was hiking trail which takes about 15-20 mins to reach the monkey park at the top as well as a cute little playground for kids. It was raining when we went and the trail was a little slick. Kind of dangerous when we were going down the hill. Good for adults and kids who like walking/hiking.

Kacho Bee,2022-12-28 03:33:51,5,1,"We support animal shelters and rescue groups and we don‚Äôt go to zoos.
Arashiyama MP is not a zoo, it‚Äôs a place where monkeys live in the wild and us humans are just allowed to come and see them. Arashiyama MP does not interfere in any way: they do not treat injuries or administer medications. They give the monkeys healthy snacks like fruit and veggies but other than that there‚Äôs no intervention.
The good news that the monkeys are self sufficient as they support each other and raise babies together, and they all look very healthy including those that are quite old now. There are several very old monkeys who are thin and slow but they‚Äôre still genki.
The MP role is supporting natural life cycle and observing.

Arashiyama MP is quite big. From the parking lot you‚Äôll have to climb hills and it‚Äôll take about 40 min. Still very doable even with little kids and there‚Äôs a small playground for them.
The MP is located on the mountain top, but you‚Äôll start seeing monkeys 10 min before you reach it.
There are a lot of monkeys living there, they‚Äôre just scattered around. There‚Äôs a feeding area so monkeys hang around there. You‚Äôll see families and babies.
No monkey onsen. You can buy healthy snacks and feed the monkeys, you‚Äôll go inside a house with wire protected windows to do that.
The view is fantastic. There are benches and those view binoculars for ¬•100. The view area is on a steep hill but there are cool trees around where you can see monkeys sleep, groom and play.

You‚Äôll see a lot of monkeys and you‚Äôll be able to see all sorts of communication patterns.
The monkeys are quite friendly to each other and people but they can sometimes get too close to people and pull on clothes and holler, just don‚Äôt be too loud and in their face, the staff will discipline them.

Animal sanctuaries where we humans can just observe animals without caging them is the best way to see animals, and both Awaji Monkey Center and Arashiyama MP provide an excellent opportunity to do that.
Google Awaji Monkey Center and see my MP and MC comparison if you want to travel to Awaji.

The view at the top is WELL worth the walk, but a word of advice: my husband and I have been bracing ourselves for our trip to Japan for MONTHS by walking great lengths and often. If you are not used to slopes, incorporate them in to your routine. Hah! I still highly recommend visiting!

Just make sure that you wear suitable clothes and footwear. This is not a zoo, but a facility to see these monkeys in their native habitat. They get really really close, but as long as you don't touch or aggrevate them they are surprisingly polite.

They run wild but come back because they love the treats. Not sure why one review said they were in cages - the fences you see in these photos are to keep HUMANS inside while feeding them! When you are not feeding, you can exit that area and be right beside then with no fence.

600yen entry per person and 300yen for kids. It's a steep 20 minute walk, so take it slow if yo7 need to a rest at the seats along the way. The view at the top is brilliant!

Shawn G,2023-05-07 22:51:39,5,1,"Very nice place to be able to see monkeys up close and front. Was afraid that they wouldn‚Äôt be out due to the rain but they were everywhere. They range from little babies to full grown adults. The only challenge I had was hiking up the hill in the rain while wearing a kimono. Recommendation: Don‚Äôt not try to visit it while wearing a kimono.

KKay,2023-05-08 04:14:51,5,0,"Costs ¬•600 per adult. The hike takes about 20 mins and is fairly steep but worth it once you get to the top. The monkeys are very polite when eating and super cute. Great view, nice hike through the jungle and lots of monkeys to see at the top.

Lin Jia Chen,2023-05-10 02:26:36,5,1,"Admission ticket is 600 yen for adult and you can also pay 50 yen to feed the monkeys. There were a lot of tourists but not too crowded. This is a highlight of Kyoto for me and I loved the experience! You get to see the monkeys freely roaming and they come up super close to humans too. So much more fun than the crowded bamboo forest.

Rheddy Setgo,2023-05-10 22:59:13,5,0,"Not super long of a hike if you are up for a 30 min uphill challenge. Not for those that have wheelchairs or strollers. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a ramp from the bottom to top of the hill. The monkeys don‚Äôt seem aggressive and you can purchase food from the shelter and feed them from the inside. They have trainers walking around to keep an eye on them. They smell is a bit strong from urine and feces but it‚Äôs natural. The view is also worth the hike. Pretty and breathtaking.

Amanda Rutherfoord,2023-05-11 16:45:10,4,1,"Fun and unique experience but be prepared to hike. You have to hike up a mountain to get here but once you‚Äôre at the top, you‚Äôll see a ton of monkeys. Bring some cash if you want to feed them! Definitely a touristy spot but we enjoyed interacting with the monkeys

Maria Eretnova,2023-05-12 09:31:12,5,0,"Entrance fee 600 yen for adults. Monkeys are chill and not aggressive towards people (it doesn't mean you can act stupid), well taken care of. Wild and free.
It will be a short hike up the hill, then there will be a nice panoramic spot and a house with caged windows where you can feed the monkeys with nuts or bananas.

Vgs photos,2023-05-12 20:38:32,5,0,"Open between 9:00am to 4:00pm is Arashiyama Monkey Park. Entry fee is 600yen for adults and 300yen for children.  You enter from the base of the small mountain and gradually climb a sereis of steps and dirt pathways until you finally reach the top. Moderate amount of physical fitness required.  As you gradually make it to the top more and more monkeys appear relaxing in their natural environments.

When you finally reach the top the views of Katsura river and Arashiyama are simply spectacular and worth the cost of entry alone.  Despite so many monkeys, like the rest of Japan the area is pristinely clean.

There are monkeys roaming freely everywhere! They are all very friendly if you keep your distance. They can be seen grooming each other. There is a sheltered/caged areas where you can also feed the monkeys. You can tell the rangers working there are really passionate about conserving and caring for the monkeys.

A must visit in Arashiyama!!

David Win Pe,2023-05-15 11:22:48,5,1,"I absolutely loved visiting this spot. It‚Äôs a steep hike up, but well worth it. There is a small entry fee, again, worth every yen üòå
It was so nice to see the monkeys not confined to cages.
They seem to do what they want up there, and are not afraid of the humans. A great sign.
We watched monkeys groom and ‚Äòmonkey around‚Äô with each other üôàüôäüôä. I could watch them for hours.
There‚Äôs a caged area to enter, and feed the monkeys through the fence. Monkeys are on the outside and hang around for the food. Peanuts and apple was on option for 50Y. A small price to pay to feed these beautiful, smart animals.
The view from up there is also amazing! Can see the whole of Kyoto with backdrop of mountains.
Thanks for having us üôè

Kimberly O'Shaughnessy,2023-05-17 11:12:23,5,0,"You need to walk uphill for about 20 min to the top to see the monkeys so wear comfortable shoes and clothes. Also you‚Äôll probably want to buy a bottle of water or two from a vending machine before the hike starts.

F√©lix Potvin („Éñ„É©„Éü),2023-05-18 12:52:36,4,1,"Pretty original and cheap activity. It's a good 20 minute climb to the top where the monkeys are.

The place itself is pretty small but there's a good amount of monkeys to take pictures of. Just have to make sure to respect the rules for your safety.

When I heard about this place, I was really excited to see it. But once there, I felt like it was a bit underwhelming. I still had fun joking around and taking pictures of the animals.

You can pay extra to go feed the monkeys and have a different angle to take pictures which can be interesting.

I highly recommend to bring snacks and water in your bag if you plan on going there since as I said, it is a pretty good walk all the way to the top. Might be hard for some people.

Finally, you also get a nice view of Kyoto from far away.

James Milner,2023-05-19 14:54:42,5,0,"It's a unique trek to the top of the mountain, takes 20 minutes and is fairly challenging. At the top is a very nice view of the city below. And of course there are monkeys to see, which are great and quite calm with so many tourists - but you should still follow the rules of the park.

Yukino Takenaka,2023-05-21 14:31:59,4,0,"It's a lot of walk to climb the mountain to see monckeys (it's really hard) but it worth going, I would say. I just don't recommend to go during the noon when the sun is the hottest in a day or mid of summer. Bring water, wear something easy to do walk. It was a good exerciseüêí

‚ùóÔ∏èIf it is hot and humid I do not recommend this to people who are prone to have issues with their health (cardiovascular) ‚ùóÔ∏è
Once you are on top of the mountain you can watch the monkeys and feed them in a special building.

It was a 20-Minute hike up but after the first 5-minute (walking up steps) it was just a steep incline that did not bother me as I was surrounded by nature and there were many stops along the way.

Alia Shapiro,2023-05-27 13:29:02,5,0,"Takes 20mins winding uphill. Wear comfortable shoes. The monkeys are adorable, does not seem to approach humans but we are well advised to keep a distance from them. There are advisory boards along the uphill to warn visitors the dos and donts. When we reach the top, the view was beautiful. It was nice timing that the feeding time started by the caretakers and you can see the feeding frenzy.

Sam Antoniadis,2023-06-02 02:00:12,4,1,"Cool little adventure in Arashiyama! The monkeys are in their own world at the park and can be found swimming, jumping around, and teasing eachother.
One thing worth mentioning is that to get to the park, you first need to make a 20 minute trek uphill. There are several spots to stop and rest, but it can get pretty brutal when the temperatures is in the 30's.

Samantha Smith,2023-06-02 12:32:38,4,0,"This park is easy to get to and a short walk from the train station. The walk up to the top takes about 20 minutes and there are plenty of places to rest if you need to catch your breath. There are plenty of warning signs regarding the monkeys themselves (do not, for any reason look the monkeys in the eyes!!!) But they are actually quite tame if you follow the rules.

The view from the top is gorgeous and you can see Kyoto in all it's entirety on a clear day. There is an opportunity to feed the monkeys, behind caged walls, when you get there. Bags of food only cost 50 yen. Watching the baby monkeys wrestle was a highlight for sure!

Someone dropped a 500ml mineral water plastic bottle and one monkey picked it up and it was so interesting to see what it did with it. It tore the plastic wrapping then shook it up and down. Next it used its sharp teeth to bite till it made a small hole and the water shot out from the small hole! We spent about one hour here!
