Trans-word plus TGM,2018-09-11 15:06:09,5,2,"Jakko-in Temple is located in the north of Sanzen-in Temple across the other side of the river. The temple belongs to Tendai sect of Buddhism with a history of over 1600 years. It was developed as a temple served by nuns ( nunnery ). The origin of the establishment of the temple is the time when the very 1st emperor of Japan ( Shotoku Taishi ) decided to place a statue of Bosatsu to appease the spirit of his father in this place. The main object of worship in this temple is Rokumantai Jizo ( Jizo stature holding spirits of 60,000 ). Unfortunately the original form of this statue could not be remained after the fire accident in 2005. It is suspected that an arsonist set fire to the main hall of the temple. The entire structure of the main hall burned down to the ground. The statue was burned but it still remains its shape after the renovation with lacquer paint cover on its surface. The statue will be displayed just twice a year when they open their treasure hall to the public. The current statue is replication of Rokumantai Jizo. The temple also holds a historical connection with Heike Clan as it was depicted in the story of Heike. A woman serving at the temple kindly offers explanation at the main hall.

J Y,2018-11-08 14:58:38,5,3," It was a very quiet temple, and the atmosphere of the surrounding shops was also very good.
I like Jakko-in, which has a lot of maple trees and a refreshing feeling, and the atmosphere around it feels more like Kyoto than temples and shrines in Kyoto city (^-^)

A book of the Tale of the Heike that was in the treasure hall of Jakkoin Temple.
Being ignorant, I wondered if it was the real thing, so I asked the people at the temple, and they said it was a manuscript from the Edo period. That's right.
Still, it has remained beautiful since the Edo period.
Japanese paper? I felt the greatness of this in many ways.

It is a relatively small temple, but I think there are many highlights such as the bell of impermanence.
Above all, the atmosphere of Satoyama up to Jakko-in Temple was irresistible, and I was excited to take a walk.

I think it is really recommended for those who are tired of visiting temples and shrines because there are many tourists in Kyoto city (^-^)

Ohara is a famous tourist spot, so there are many people, but this place itself is quiet. There is something about the recluse life here that makes a lot of sense. If possible, I would like to go here early in the morning. If you go early in the morning before it gets crowded, you can feel the history and immerse yourself in a quiet environment.

The autumn leaves coloring the stone steps leading to the temple gate are admiring, and the deep moss on the roof of the gate in front of the Koun (tea house) entrance is also impressive. The highlights are the colored leaves of the mountains behind the main shrine, the well-maintained garden, and the collaboration between the hanging bell and the colored leaves.

板倉弘光,2020-07-14 04:46:50,5,10," It is a temple associated with the Tale of the Heike. It takes about 15 minutes on foot from Sanzen-in Temple to arrive. As some of you may have learned in your high school classics class, the sound of the bells of the Gion Shoja has a reverberation of impermanence. The color of the flowers of the sal tree represents the principle of prosperity and decline. There are two that are written. When it comes to Kyoto, many people tend to visit temples for Buddhist statues, but I think this temple is a temple that brings back memories of the Heike Monogatari.
The sal tree is also known as the summer camellia, and it scatters in a day. Isn't that also going to depend on the decline of the prosperous person?

The trees block the summer sunlight, and negative ions rain down from overhead.
It is also a power spot where the power of nature is very transmitted.

There is a reception on the right hand side when you enter the entrance.
Admission fee is 600 yen per adult

When you climb the stone stairs, you will see the signboard of Jakko-in Temple.

It's a nice place with shutter positions everywhere.
When everyone was a photographer, the person in charge took a picture in the best position.
Very kind.

When you enter the main hall, there is also an explanation of how to visit, the history of the temple, etc.

It is a very fulfilling space.

It is a place where you can see Yakult in 20 to 30 minutes by going around the whole place.

There is a parking lot when you go down the narrow road with a rental car. There are some parking lots along the way, but if you go past them, you will come to a parking lot near the dead end.

When you start climbing the stairs, you will be surrounded by rich greenery and feel like you are in an inner parlor. The history of Jakko-in Temple and the response to lectures are helpful and appreciated.
It reminds me of phrases I've heard in Heike Monogatari, such as Sara Soju and Shogyo Mujou.

Went on a weekday when it was quiet. There were no other worshipers and I was able to visit in a solemn mood. I was grateful that the person who explained at the main hall came all the way out and explained various things.
It has a deep connection with the Heike Monogatari, and the garden on the west side of the main hall remains unchanged from that time.
There is a moss-covered stone, and in the back is the bell of impermanence. In addition, the ruins of Kenreimonin's hermitage, which is located on the mountain behind the main hall, is where Kenreimonin, the daughter of Taira no Kiyomori, spent time at this temple after the fall of the Taira clan.

After paying 600 yen at the reception, visit the Jizo statue in the main hall. In May 2000, the news that the main hall was completely burned due to arson was shocking😢
However, there was Jizo Bodhisattva who continued to stand dignified. It's still in storage, and I've seen it on TV only on special days.
What surprised me was that a small Buddha statue miraculously remained inside this Buddha.

Before long, both the main hall and Kenreimonin statue were restored, and there are many female worshipers who know this history. In front of the main hall, there are Migiwa-no-Ike, the stone of the beach, and the cherry blossoms of the beach, which were mentioned in the Tale of the Heike. And the bells of Gion Seisha in the pond in front of all sides...

Because it is a small precinct, there are only elegant people who say ""Please, I'm sorry"". Also, there are many requests for photo shutters here.

Fivestar DX (Kevin1Q6Q),2022-09-29 12:25:09,5,0," Just reading the Tale of the Heike in comics, and seeing the Battle of Dannoura in a historical drama, made me think of Kenreimonin, the daughter of Taira no Kiyomori. I wondered if the Heike clan and Emperor Antoku had been holding memorial services at this temple for a long time. I was able to see it quietly and slowly. The moss-covered roof and walls around the gate also give a sense of history.

I think it would be better to find a parking lot at.

The temple stands in silence, and if you are familiar with The Tale of the Heike, you can feel the impermanence of all things.

It is said that the Gohonzon was burnt down in a fire, but it has now been restored. In the main hall, you can explain the history of this place.
In addition, a special autumn exhibition of the old principal image ""Rokumantai Jizo Bosatsu"" will be held from October 22nd to January 27th.
It's just the season when the autumn leaves are beautiful, so I definitely want to go visit.

TAKASHI SASAKI,2022-11-04 00:39:10,5,2," I used the subway and bus from Kyoto Station.
There is a bus to Ohara from in front of Kokusaikaikan station, and it takes about 15 minutes on foot to the northwest from there. Sanzen-in Temple is about a 10-minute walk east from the Ohara bus stop.

It was the beginning of November and the autumn leaves had not yet started, but the beautiful moss garden was beautiful.

The store in front of this building is closed. That's why the hospital is sparsely populated. It will be a quiet area. I hope you never break the silence.

As a route to visit the Ohara area, take a bus from Kyoto Station,
Take the subway to Kokusaikaikan Station and take the bus from there. If it is an international hall, it is possible to think of schedules for junior and senior high school athletic meets and cultural festivals in autumn. On the day of the event, the flow of guardians is inevitable.
It's not always possible to make tea easily, so there's no doubt that you'll have to do some homework.

It is a beautiful temple with blue maple and autumn leaves.
A nearby parking lot is operated for a fee.

There is also a small museum in the courtyard introducing the history and cultural relics of Jiguangyuan. It is worth spending some time to visit.
It is a scenic spot not to be missed when visiting Ohara Sanzen-in Temple.

[Experience]
It is a temple deep in the mountains of Kyoto.
It's relatively small.
When I went there, it was raining, so there were no other visitors, so luckily, when I went to the main shrine, I was able to receive an explanation from the people involved in the temple.
It is said that the daughter of the Heike family (who later became a nun) just finished her life.

However, it is in a different direction from Ohara Sanzen-in Temple.

It is a nunnery with a history of 1400 years, and it was a temple that made me feel the depth of history especially from the atmosphere and appearance of the surroundings.
It was a place where I could indulge in various thoughts, with all the episodes carved in the long history and the characters I saw and heard in historical stories and dramas.
I was very moved by the sound of the bells that I heard at 17:00 in the evening.
Even in Kyoto, which has many killer contents, you can feel a different atmosphere here.

I arrived around 8:40, but I can't see the entrance gate. There is no gate on the other side of the garden across the road, so you can enter, but the back gate says to go around to the main gate. After repeatedly going back and forth for more than 10 minutes, it seems that the security camera at the back gate caught me, and I was told to enter through the main gate in front of the store. When I went to the front of the shop, the main gate was open. I don't know because it closes early in the morning. The garden on the back gate side is open, so let's wait while looking at the garden. There are also benches. Listening to the stories of the young nuns at the main shrine will cleanse your soul. I paid a 50-yen offering (usually 5 yen).

I feel that it will be a place that represents Ohara for those who know the Tale of the Heike, where is enshrined.
``Floating in the pond, drifting in the waves, and doubting if the brocade is exposed, the pale purple color of the wisteria hanging on the pine trees of Nakajima''
