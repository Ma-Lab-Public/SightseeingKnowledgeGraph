Omoroi Life,2021-11-11 06:18:03,5,4,"One of the most famous temples in Kyoto, this structure is a delight to enjoy with great views, but still with relatively easy access. But due to this fact, is extremely crowded during tourist seasons. Architecturally this temple is very interesting, as it was built extending off the mountain peak. The street leading up to the temple is filled with lots of great shops, with a variety of goods.

It was undergoing renovations for several years before 2020 but it looks to have been fully restored.

As it is one of the most popular attractions in Kyoto, do plan to go early morning, as soon as it opens at 9am. It‚Äôs a nice starting point for a day of sightseeing in Gion, etc.

Saurabh,2022-03-22 03:05:08,5,4,"Kiyomizudera literally translates to ""Pure Water Temple"", being one of the most popular temples in Japan, it was founded in the year 780 during Nara period (when Nara was the capital of Japan, ruled over by an empress). The current buildings in Kiyomizudera were constructed by Tokugawa Iemitsu from the Tokugawa Shogunate. This temple is one of the most important Buddhist temples in Japan and a part of Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto UNESCO world heritage sites.
A popular expression ""to jump off the stage at Kiyomizu"" is assoicated with Kiyomizudera, referring to an Edo-period tradition saying that if one were to survive a 13-meter jump from the stage, one's wish would be granted. During the Edo period, 234 jumps were recorded, and of those, 85.4% survived, this practice was prohibited in 1872.
Kiyomizudera is one of the most important places to visit in Kyoto, having beautiful foliage during Spring and especially during Autumn. Being located on the foothills of Mount Otowa, one can get a serene view of Kyoto and can even see the Kyoto tower on a clear day.
The temple organizes special nigh illuminations during Autumn and Spring season so be sure to check out if you are in Kansai.

Neatly paved narrow alleyways that lead to Kiyomizu-dera are by themselves an experience to look for.

The complex is very clean and situated in the middle of green hillocks that surround it.

Glee Glee,2022-11-18 12:53:49,3,8,"My dad has mobility issues so we had a taxi drop us off as close as he could get.  It was still a bit of an uphill walk to the foot of the stairs leading to the temple.

To get there you go up a street lined with shops and it looks like Japan must have looked once long ago.  The shops sell typical souvenir items like fans, cloth wallets, handkerchiefs and so forth.  There are also various Japanese style snacks and treats.  It's very fun to explore the shops but so crowded!  It's hard to even interrupt the crowd to dart across the street.

My dad required frequent breaks to catch his breath and there was nowhere to sit among the throngs of people so he would lean against a building for a bit.  He made it to the foot of the temple but we knew that was as far as he could go.  He parked himself on some steps and waited for me there.

Up some steps and a bit of a walk there were a couple of places where you can throw your 10 yen, clap your hands, and make a wish.  The buildings were ancient looking and large and impressive, and the views of the mountain were absolutely breathtaking.  But the throngs of people made it difficult to fully appreciate the surroundings.

I like to get my book stamped with calligraphy at the various temples and it's a bit different at each one where you go.  Some do it where they sell omamori, others have separate windows further in.  Some have vertical lines straight from the window, others have winding horizontal lines roped off.  I saw a window with a throng of people.  As far as I could tell there was no line so I waited for the throng to clear to approach.  Several people darted in front of me at the left window, so I asked the man at the right window in my halting Japanese if they do the stamps there.  A standing man behind him spoke to me very rudely to get me to go to a different place to get the stamps.  I don't remember his exact words but I remember his admonishing tone and rudeness and demeanor  very well.  I'm not by nature someone who feels entitled to ignore rules.  There were no signs in English explaining the procedure.  I felt  a bit humiliated after that and I had no wish to look around further.  I did get my book stamped and it was sloppily done.  Then I headed down the way I came back to dad.

The beauty and majesty of the place is a 5.  The crowds and jostling bring it down to a 4.  The rudeness of the temple dude makes it a 3.

Been there twice in the last month, once on a public holiday another on a normal weekday. Both times the area was crazy packed. If you‚Äôre willing to brave the crowds, it‚Äôs definitely worth a visit.

Beautiful Diver,2023-03-21 15:55:54,5,4,"It is a famous temple in Kyoto that everyone knows.  I've been here many times in the past, but the scenery of Kyoto that can be seen from the hanging main hall and Okunoin, as well as the splendid autumn foliage, is a charm that keeps me coming back.  It is also a good place to visit early in the morning.  From the direction of Kodaiji Temple, climb Ichinenzaka and Ninenzaka, stop at Yasaka Pagoda on the way, and then climb Sanneizaka to Kiyomizudera Temple.

We went during the day and the villages and stores on the way up were more crowded than the temple.

Beautiful views even more beautiful village leading up to the Temple. I recommend going to the Temple first then making your way down to shop and eat.

This can easily be an all day event, we only spent 4hrs there, wish we spent more! Don‚Äôt forget to visit the Starbucks with tatami mats!

Kyungie Lee,2023-03-27 16:54:11,4,0,"The place isn't so large, but it is on a hill, so you can expect quite a hike to get here. There is a snack stall inside to enjoy a bit of local traditional food. There's a 400 yen entrance fee if I am not mistaken. Just like some other big temple, you can get omikuji here, and they also sell omamori.

The temple looks breathtaking during Sakura season as well as during fall. Now that tourism is open again the temple grounds were really crowded and one should prefer going early in the day if you want to spend more time here in peace.

As well as there being very little vending machines for water so prepare adequately. The view of the city is nice, and there are many cherry blossoms in bloom.

JJ,2023-04-05 03:47:50,5,0,"Popular temple located in the heart of Kyoto's bustling Gion area. When I visited, it was very crowded, but the beauty of the temple was still undeniable.

It‚Äôs quite a commercial temple, with souvenir sellers basking good luck charms.

There‚Äôs also an area where you can pour water on your hands and drink them as a sign of good luck.

My favourite part about this temple is the temple grounds as you walk out to the exit. The view is particularly beautiful during the seasons.

Danielle M,2023-04-05 04:37:04,5,1,"Soooo many people but so worth it! Go near sunset and you‚Äôll be able to catch the most amazing view. Also, bring a long selfie stick and you can catch the iconic image by reaching your selfie stick above everyone‚Äôs heads otherwise you‚Äôll be trying to get yourself through rows and rows of people all trying to get that iconic image.

Parking is fairly difficult as all the lots near the temple are packed and traffic down the tiny roads are fierce as it‚Äôs one lane up and down. Because of the number of people, strollers are very hard to get around so I recommend leaving them behind.

Masumi M,2023-04-08 03:09:25,4,1,"Visited the temple at night. Night cherry blossom is a must see as well as the temple and Kyoto city. I thought that would be easier/helpful for us especially elder people and children to walk around the areas if they put more lights on the path. It was a little dark for us to walk on the path at night. We often followed people in front of us. Overall it‚Äôs a beautiful shrine and worth to visit.

The walk up is filled with shops, filled with trinkets and treats, and people (a lot in kimonos due to the rentals shops)! The temple is beautiful and has a great view of Kyoto, admission is 400 yen, but the place does close at 6 pm. It would take about an hour or 2 to experience everything (there are some lines for tiny experiences such as washing hands with holy water). Definitely a place I'd add to any Kyoto itinerary!

Temple and view were okay, not bad. Liked the quieter and more peaceful areas

Darren N,2023-04-14 13:42:54,5,0,"Possibly the most picturesque shrine in Kyoto. On top of its intricate architecture and illustrious history, the shrine has a panoramic view of Kyoto city as it is perched on the hill. Perfect spot for photography enthusiasts. The walking streets of Higashiyama that leads from the foot of the hill all the way to the shrine has a great mix of shops that sells souvenirs, handicrafts to soba noodles and Japanese snacks. You might also want to rent a kimono for the day to experience life in ancient Kyoto.

SL Wong,2023-04-28 12:41:43,5,1,"What made this place special was supposedly, the legends of the past has it that long ago people would go to the platform to make a wish, and they would jump down the platform and if they survived, their wish will be granted.. of course, don't be stupid/silly, and try to attempt this in this modern era. You'll probably end up dead or disabled for life.

Aside from that, this temple is very beautiful! There is a small entrance fee you need to pay to enter. You can walk around the area and even queue up to drink/bring home some holy temple water.

There are also shops that sell desert and food and with a great view too. The night scenery seems to be majestic as well!

Nice place to visit especially if you are interested in looking or admiring how the wooden base structures holds the building strongly. The view is beautiful and definitely worth the entrance fees. Inside, they sell small gifts that you can buy as souvenirs back. You can also get your luck read-out. However this place is always packed with people. This was actually my second time here; the last time I came, there's were some night events so the opening hours were extended. Perhaps it's a good idea to check and plan which day you'd like to visit this beautiful place and best if the opening hours were extended.

When you come to Kyoto, this would be your first choice for visiting. It‚Äôs my 2nd time here. I was very lucky to see the Snowing Kyoto and Kiyomizu-dera. Everything is white and snowing, it‚Äôs cold but so beautiful. The snowing world with such great historic building would lead you back to old Japan. You can suddenly feel like you were living in the old Japan, and see the old people just in the temple to pray for the lucky like you do. Really recommend if have a chance must be coming as a snowing season.

Leo H.,2023-05-28 13:35:46,4,1,"Kiyomizdera can get really busy real fast. The main attraction is the Main Hall and how it's constructed suspending on a cliff.
All the other temples dotted around the grounds are very picturesque, but most of them are off limits to tourists, except for Zuigudo Hall.
Zuigudo Hall has a tunnel running in the dark that one can walk through.
The main hall costs 400 yen to enter. Not a lot of things to do here beside line up to pray, or buy souvenirs. The architecture is marvelous, though you have to contend the view with other visitors.
Exiting the Main Hall takes you to the viewing platform where you can take a picture, but again, there are too many people here even during winter.
