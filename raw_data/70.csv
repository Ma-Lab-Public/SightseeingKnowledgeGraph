Gyuri Zelena,2019-03-05 12:43:09,5,0,"This is one of the busiest streets in Kyoto, nicely maintained without the horrible look of the cables hanging everywhere. It is full of souvenir shops and other small stores.

It would be really nice in general, but we apparently went at a wrong time because it was extremely crowded - perhaps it is always the case, I don't know.

It has no direct train access, some bus stops are around but if you prefer to walk, it's 15-20 minutes to the nearest station. On the top end of the street you'll find the amazing shrine with nice views over Kyoto.

Charles,2020-02-14 03:11:57,5,0,"Sanneizaka street is a must go, on the 2 side along the street there are authentic shops sell Japan traditional sweets/pastry and art work. But you must know how to walk. First you need to go to Kiyomizu dera temple another must go place. It is because Kiyomizu dera is on the higher ground, when you walking along the Sanneizaka street to Nineizaka Temple, you are walking downhill. It will be more relax and able to appreciate the shops more compare to walking uphill which is more hectic, struggle to walk uphill how so you enjoy the journey. When you reach Nineizaka temple which is a small and no so famous temple. You can move on to Kodaiji Temple and Yasaka Shrine (downhill). You know what I mean. RELAX a bit.

Naimisha Sanjay,2023-06-11 19:32:17,5,1,"Sannenzaka is an absolutely beautiful street in Kyoto that leads to the iconic Kiyomizu-dera temple. While we were disappointed to find the shops closed and rain pouring down during our visit, the walk itself was still a delightful experience.

Strolling along Sannenzaka is like stepping back in time, as the street is lined with traditional wooden buildings and cobblestone paths. The old-world charm and picturesque scenery make it a must-visit location in Kyoto.

Although we missed out on exploring the shops due to their closure, we couldn't help but appreciate the architectural beauty and cultural ambiance of the street. The traditional atmosphere is truly enchanting, transporting you to a different era.

If you plan to visit Sannenzaka, I would recommend checking the store timings in advance to avoid disappointment. Knowing the opening hours will allow you to make the most of your visit and experience the vibrant energy of the street.

Regardless of the shop closures, the walk through Sannenzaka is still worthwhile. The historical charm, stunning surroundings, and the anticipation of reaching Kiyomizu-dera create an atmosphere of intrigue and anticipation.

Sannenzaka is a beautiful street that shouldn't be missed when exploring Kyoto. While it's advisable to check the store timings in advance, the walk itself offers a glimpse into the city's rich history and architectural beauty.
