One of the most viewed photos while searching for Japans sight seeing.
The iconic building,shrines,Tori Gates are beautiful architectured.
It takes about 30-45min by walk to reach the top of the mountain.
Due to its tremendous history, Fushimi Inari Taisha is always crowded.

It winds and winds and you get the feeling while in the tori gates  tunnels  that you are heading toward an encounter  with the gods! Simply Wow!

Morgan Bayrasli,2022-04-09 13:26:42,5,59,"It lives up to thy hype!
Fushimi Inari Taisha is one of the most iconic spots in Japan and for good reason. This temple and hike is beautiful. Photos don’t do it justice.

The hike took my family about 80 minutes total. We had a 6 year old and a two year old with us and both did well with all the stairs. My two year old did need to be carried from time to time, but mostly going downhill. I would say this is definitely a child friendly activity.

The crowd levels were astonishingly lower than I expected. This lead to more time on the path alone and a more peaceful climb. **

I recommend bringing yen on the climb as there are plenty of places to buy bottle water, tea, and even ice cream at the view point.

This temple is easily assessable by train and is located just outside of the station.

**Disclaimer* My family and I went in spring of 2022 where Japan was still closed to tourist. If you are coming when the county is reopened be prepared for bigger crowds than I experienced

Van W.,2022-10-25 09:18:00,5,7,"This place is amazingly beautiful and shows how much Japanese people respect this shrine by looking at those thousands of gates. It's so cool. If you come to kyoto, this place is a must! I tried hiking up there just half way (the first loop). Let's say, it requires some good health to do so as it's up and down the hill. It was a good hike for the first loop taking around 1 hour and a half to do so. Good exercise!

Arash Khosravi,2022-11-03 01:05:58,5,1,"The shrine gates are really a site to behold - the sheer number of them leading you up the mountain, each inscribed and with their distinct colouring.

The start of the trail is very busy and there are lots of people taking photos and selfies which is why I'd recommend heading a bit further up and if you have the energy, reaching the very top! It is a bit of work but probably about 40 mins to get to the top but there are different routes you can take to shorten the trip and stop at other points. We went at about 9:30 in the morning on a weekday and it was fairly busy but not too bad (no people traffic jams - only a rogue car as shown in my photos !)

The higher you get, the less people you encounter and the more views you'll see so lots of opportunities for pictures.

There are also lots of shrines, big and small, on the way which are well worth visiting on your journey. The stalls selling trinkets and food/drink are also worth stopping in, even if it's just to have a bit of a break!

Not so many possibilities for views over the city, but there’s plenty to see and experience.
Also wild but cuddly cats. Warnings about wild boars and monkeys (don’t pet them!), but I didn’t see any.

There are lots of brilliant photo opportunities, and getting there early lets you get the best photos of the iconic gates. There are a few different routes to take, so you can make your visit as long or short as you'd like. Getting to the top in the heat can get uncomfortable though.

Taylor Miles,2022-12-11 03:36:34,5,1,"What a wonderful experience this was! I had read many blogs about how crowded Mount Inari gets which is also very true now that Japan is opening back up.
My recommendation is to get there when the sun rises (I arrived around 0700 on a Sunday) before the subway becomes congested. It also becomes quieter and less crowded as you ascend up the mountain.
There are plenty of photo opportunities along the way and the scenery is so peaceful. The entire hike took about 2.5 hours as I walk slowly and stop to see many sights.

Maayan Dahan,2022-12-21 12:47:20,5,1,"Probably one of the reasons a tourist will visit Japan would be this place. With the countless red gate-like artifacts creating a maze, you can easily get lost both physically and emotionally as it is getting to you deep.

If it's too crowded you'll find it hard to take pictures but here's a trick- most people stop at the first points of the maze to take dozens of pictures (or more), just keep walking another few minutes and you'll find better spots less crowded and way quieter ^^

This is easily a spot for all types of tourists, from families and groups to hikers and backpackers ~ good for your social media and your experience ^^

Walk inside to see signature thousands of shrines dedicated to Inari, the Shinto god of rice and have some photos along this walkway.

The shrine can also be reached in a short walk from Fushimi Inari Station along the Keihan Main Line.

Cecilia Chung,2023-01-28 00:53:09,5,2,"If you could only see 1 thing in Kyoto, I'd recommend the Fushimi Inari Taisha. It is famous for its thousands of red gates that have been donated by believers, lined up as you go up the mountain.

There will be many other tourists trying to take nice photos on the gates. If you have time, hike up to the crossroads (about mid-way or 2/3 of the way), where there will be so few people, it will be much easier to take nice shots.

We went in January after a big snow period, and it was even more beautiful than when I went in the spring time. Snow adds a layer of magic to the place.

The shrine has 13 cats, apparently. We saw 3 of them, and they're friendly enough to be pet, but please respect them and their environment.

Before entering the mountain, there are a lot of stands for traditional snacks, and on the mountain you'll still find some from time to time.

セノウエプリンセス,2023-02-11 15:05:24,5,1,"Fushimi Inari Shrine is famous for it’s 10,000 gates but really there are over 32,000 gates and sub-gates called torii in Japanese. It is one of the most must visit sites in Kyoto.

It is very accessible if you will come by train. There are nearby coin parking as well. You can park for free on the main parking if you are going to worship.

It gets crowded even in weekdays. It’s difficult to take a good photo in the entrance because there are lots of people taking pictures as well.

There is a pond and rest area where you can have some tea time.

If you want to go to the mountain, you need to wear comfy shoes. There’s no rest room on top so you better empty your bladder before going up.

Unlike Kyoto’s other tourist attractions, there is no entrance fee.

It will be difficult if you have baby car so it is better to have a baby carrier instead.

Overall, it was a great experience going here.

Upon entering, you'd have 1000 gods you can visit and pray to all around the mountain 🏔️. Beautiful temples and shrines everywhere along with friendly CATS everywhere on this mountain. Walking up the mountain through thousands of red gate is so beautiful and make the hiking much more fulfilling. You'd have alot of split ways to more shrine or ancient castle 🏯 up the mountain and the further you go, the more beautiful sacred lakes, scenery, forest and shrine you'd see and explore. You can go to the top of the mountain through 3 or so different ways and going down could also be done through a different way which is what made the mountain so masterious and enjoyable. They still open at night and the road will be escorted with night lights so it'll still be beautiful at night, just less crowded whereas in the morning and after, it'll be super full. 10/10 will come again to the very top and stay for the beautiful sunset or beautiful city light from atop.

We ended up taking the side track up but came down the main track. The main track up was ridiculous with lots of people wanting to take photos on an already busy track. There was hardly anyone on the side track and we got to see some very traditional and unstaged shrines. I don't mean that to sound disrespectful,  they were just really raw and we got to feel the sacredness of them because there weren't herds of people. On the way down the crowds had evened out so you can see by the pics we managed to get some alone shots.

Kristine Lim,2023-02-24 16:08:31,5,2,"Absolutely worth it to go here. I understand now why this is such a popular tourist destination! I went before sunset (4pm) and stayed until after sunset (6pm). It was really cool getting to see the shrine in the daylight, at sunset, and at night. The shrine casts some cool shadows on the ground at nighttime. There are lights along the path so you can still see and walk in the dark without needing a flashlight. Seeing the sunset there was also really beautiful too — there are amazing lookout points along the way that give you great views of the entire city.

I also thought this was a place people only went to to take pictures and then leave. If that is all you are interested in, you can absolutely do just that. But I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there’s a whole walk you can do that takes you around the entire mountain. The loop takes about 30-40 minutes to complete. Would highly recommend setting aside a good chunk of your day (1-2 hours or so) to fully appreciate the beauty of this place.

Also, a quick tip about staying hydrated!: If you want something to drink during your walk and don’t want to get scammed by the vending machines along the path of the shrine, definitely grab a drink from the vending machines before entering the shrine, or from a convenience store. I saw vending machines selling water for 220¥ while doing the loop around the mountain, which is the most I’ve ever seen. I waited until I exited the shrine, and found water from a vending machine for 100¥. Just a warning!

Julien Bouteyre,2023-02-25 13:59:16,5,10,"A must see for everyone traveling to Japan. I can only recommend climbing to the top via the little trail you can take a some point just on the right side. Way less crowded and through a bamboo forest, a few stairs towards the end to connect back to the ""main"" climbing path.

Even if it was crowded at the beginning there is still some room for some nice photos and video without anyone.

Do cater a full day here to have ample time to properly explore and admire the scenery and structures.
We went late noon thinking to spend at most two hours and we were so wrong!

Upon entry, you'll be greeted with several temple looking structures which are beautiful to look at!
Then you'll go through some mini torii gates before you get greeted by the main character. We walked for a good one hour plus only to realize we're in mid mountain and nowhere near to completing the route.
With tons of regrets we had to turn back and walk our way down without being able to complete the journey.

On our way down we say many little shrines that looks interesting but we didn't have the time to fully admire and understand what they were about.

So do cater more time if you're visiting! We'll definitely be back again to complete the 'quest'!

I really recommend finding the ‘secret path’ going into the bamboo forest - take the left tori gate tunnel as indicated, then the one climbing to your left, but instead of following it to the top, find the small steep path on the right and keep going. You will find a small shrine, a bamboo forest, insanely beautifully moss-covered shrines and stones, and a 15 minutes stairs climb to the top. Then you can go down the stairs under the iconic red tori gates. The whole thing take less than two hours and is SO worth it!

Towards the top it does get less crowded and you can enjoy the scenery and surrounding nature a lot more.
There are vending machines at the stops along the way, usually with a shop selling beverages and sweets. Benches to rest are not available everywhere so be prepared to walk for a while.
Restrooms are available at certain stops also. Recommend getting there as early as possible. Pre-booking not required.

Peggy G,2023-04-29 22:44:11,5,4,"Amazing experience indeed. It’s not a short visit if you want to go through the mountain tour, it takes about 2h but it is worth it rather than just staying down and visiting the most common areas. There are much less people as you go higher indeed and it’s a lovely hike in a forest through beautiful Shinto red gates. Not a forest walk you’ll do anywhere else! Beautiful experience indeed. It’s also a great opportunity to see the Shinto shrines with the foxes and the mini red gates :)

Michael Vunshtein,2023-05-02 10:14:58,4,1,"This place is massive and gets packed really fast.
The further you go up the mountain following the Tori gates path, the less people you'll encounter.
Be prepared for a lot of steps, some steep, while walking up to the top of the mountain to reach the shrine.
Also, if you walk behind the main shrine there is a nice spot with great view of Kyoto.

Ryan L,2023-05-03 11:13:56,5,2,"This is an enchanting destination that should not be missed during your visit to Kyoto.

You start at the base of sacred Mount Inari and wind through a picturesque trail through thousands of vibrant red Torii gates. The trail spans about 4km and took us about 2 hours to complete to the top of the summit and back. There are convenient rest areas and food shops along the way with ice cream and other foods.

The crowds were very heavy near the start, but as you ascend the mountain, the crowds thin out and give you more intimate moments with the incredible sights through the forest. The hike is paved and features stairways, so if you plan on going up to the summit, be mindful of having proper shoes. Along the way up, you'll encounter various stunning viewpoints of the city.

mordekai brami,2023-05-23 18:48:50,4,1,"An important Shinto temple, very fascinating and spectacular in its beauty thanks to its thousands of gates. ""Inari"" is the god of rice and his messengers are foxes, so fox statues are scattered all over the mountain. Purification is performed before entering the temple of the hands and mouth... but not to drink. At first the ascent does not seem challenging... the pictorial description of the ascent to the mountain does not seem threatening at all but it is actually thousands of gates that were a physical challenge for us but also a lot of fun. You can't stop taking pictures on the site, simply spectacular in its beauty. Only when descending from the mountain do you notice the inscription on each gate indicating the details of the financial donor for its placement. It is about 400,000 yin for a small gate and about 1 million yin for a large one. Definitely a recommended visit that we stayed for about half a day.

Early in the morning or late evening/ night are the best times to find the place with few people. Also, the further one goes, the number of people drops. It's not unusual to find patches of empty corridors distally. Undoubtedly, not to be missed!

Luckily my hotel is just 15-20 minutes away from this great place so I got to come very early - 4:30AM early which I really recommend to go as there is still no group of tourists. You may bump into 1-2 early risers as well but you can definitely solo the towers.

I will definitely go back to this sacred and very beautiful place.

SO MANY STAIRS. if you go at night bring some light with you, there is illumination throughout the route but it can be dark in certain areas... I have missed a step or two. I would also recommend comfortable shoes if you're planning on going all the way to the top. I was wearing a dress.... for the gram, but I was heaving and huffing the whole way.

Cause of social media the place has become crowded, sadly. If you wanna enjoy it and get good solo pics, go higher up. Not a lot of the people want too go all the way up for pictures.

Just a reminder if you want too go to the very top, at a chill relaxed pace it'll take you between 40mins - 1hr+. Depending if you stop and take pictures. There's small stores going up the mountain to buy drinks and small snacks and other cool stuff.

Wear proper footwear and stay hydrated also

Yee Howe Wong,2023-06-08 13:25:21,4,0,"This is one of, if not the most, famous attractions in Kyoto with its distinctive thousand torii concept and numerous shinto shrines dedicated to the gods with fox spirits as guardians of these temples. The entire temple complex is free to enter, and it is located just outside Inari Station (JR Nara line from Kyoto). The main temple is at the base of the mountain, and easy to access. On the other hand, the main attraction is the paths with the thousand tori gates, which you can choose to visit just the first few metres if you are not very fit and you just want the photos (but the crowds might mean you don't get solo photos). If you are fit and willing to climb, it is about 2500 steps to the summit, or about 2000 steps to the famous photo taking spot (this empty rocky area with chairs and a vending machine) - this will take you at least 15 minutes (if you run up the hill like I did, cos this is my 2nd time here already). I only give 4 stars and not 5 stars because of the mosquitoes, especially as the sun sets.

Jonathan Cottrell,2023-06-09 09:42:50,5,2,"This is one of the must visit experiences of Kyoto. If you plan on hiking up to the summit, you should plan on around a 2-hour experience, depending on the crowds. We went on a weekday in the late afternoon, which proved to serve us well in the crowd department, with fewer people as we hiked upward.

The one thing that is worth knowing is that, beyond one of the viewing points, where you feel like you have a great view of the city, you won’t see the city again when you keep hiking to the summit. So, if all you want is the view, stop there. Otherwise, it’s just another shrine at the summit.

Last but not least, bring water and wear good, supportive shoes. It’s a real hike, and not for the faint.

Naimisha Sanjay,2023-06-11 18:53:25,5,1,"Fushimi Inari in Kyoto is an absolute must-visit destination that lives up to all the hype. It's a truly beautiful place where you can spend quality time and capture stunning photographs. If you're looking to take solo pictures, I highly recommend going early in the morning when the crowds are thinner.

The best spots for photography are often found at the end of the trail, as many visitors don't make it all the way to the final stretch. This gives you a unique opportunity to capture unforgettable shots in a serene and picturesque setting.

Fushimi Inari is not just a place for stunning visuals; it's also a cultural experience that allows you to immerse yourself in the essence of Japan. As you walk through the famous torii gates, you can feel the history and spirituality surrounding you, creating a truly memorable journey.

I highly recommend visiting Fushimi Inari to anyone looking for an authentic and captivating experience in Kyoto. Whether you're a photography enthusiast, a culture seeker, or simply someone who appreciates the beauty of nature, this place has something special to offer. Don't miss out on the opportunity to explore and embrace the true essence of Japan at Fushimi Inari.

Do wear comfortable shoes and appropriate bag as it is quite a lot of hiking to do! The place is huge and much larger than I thought! Do plan your time wisely :)

There are queues for certain stops for photo ops but don’t bother to queue as the higher you climb the lesser people there are. The climb can get tiring as there are a lot of steps. But it’s perfectly fine to stop by the side of the stairs to rest for a couple of minutes before continuing. There is a spot for scenic view and in my opinion it is enough and better than the very top. Don’t bother climbing to the top as it will disappoint you, not justified with the number of stairs.

Anthony Bao,2023-06-17 03:41:45,1,2,"This place is the best example of too many tourists ruining a location. Everyone is here trying to get pictures for their Instagram, and because there are thousands of people being squished into a line of Tori gates that they have to walk through, you end up with a continuous line of people. On the way uphill, odds are that random folks will stop for pictures and slow everyone else down.

It’s a human traffic jam.

You can climb quite high up the mountain. If you plan on getting to the top, assume it’ll take about 50-60 minutes, and another 30 to get back down. Remember you’re lined up behind others, so while you might be in shape, others will slow the line down. Bring some water; while there are places to buy drinks, they close at odd hours.

I really, really recommend against coming here. Yes, it’s free admission, but all you’re doing is joining a queue to go up and down some stairs. It’s not very fun when there’s so many people.

But if you do come, I would suggest showing up before 8 am, or after 6 pm.

There are many stages up the mountain and it is quite hard to walk up to the peak. I took around 1.5 hours of casual walking to reach the top. It was well worth it after eating so much in Japan.

For the elderly or those with difficulty walking, just go to the halfway point.
