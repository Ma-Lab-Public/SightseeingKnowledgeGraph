Reservation required. Since it is under the jurisdiction of the Imperial Household Agency, the guide is quite solid.
Visit during the time of young leaves and the time just before autumn leaves. (The photo was taken in early May the year before last.)
There is a difference in elevation, and since it is a 3km walk, it may be difficult for those who are tired. Also, it takes about 15 minutes to get to Shugakuin Imperial Villa from the nearest bus stop. In the summer, there are few shaded areas, so it may feel difficult. (You might want to bring a parasol.)
The scenery seen from above is refreshing.

When we arrived at the gate, some people were waiting there, most of whom were old ones. The staff was also a senior man; he asked us to wait a moment. Then we entered the gate and saved our backpack and waited in a room watching introduction videos. Visitors were grouped in a team of more than fifteen. There were only guides speaking Japanese. The Japanese garden moved us, although in such an early spring. What shocked me was that there were still farms between the three villas which farmers still farm since the 1960s.

On the day of the visit, the staff of the Imperial Household Agency will guide you in a group while explaining. Admission is free. The name of the place is derived from the fact that a temple called Shugakuin was originally built here. It is a vast mountain villa with a total area of ​​more than 545,000 square meters, with Mt. It consists of three detached palaces, upper, middle and lower, and the lower detached palace has a beautiful garden called Jugetsukan to the south. Churikyu also has Rakushiken and Kyakuden with beautiful gardens to the south, where you can enjoy the beautiful brushes of the Kano school and Okyo Maruyama. One of the best places to visit is the reception hall, where you can see the Kasutana, which is called the three shelves of the world, together with the Katsura-dana of Katsura Imperial Villa and the Daigo-dana of Daigo Sanbo-in, and you can even take pictures of the gods. The Kami Rikyu, the biggest attraction, has a beautiful circuit-style garden surrounding a large pond called Yokuryu-ike. The elevation difference from Shimo Rikyu is nearly 40m, and the view of Kyoto from here is superb. In addition, the greenery that spreads over the embankment of Yokuryu Pond harmonizes with the surrounding fields, creating a very beautiful scenery. Since it is a group activity, it is really difficult to take pictures while listening to the explanation of the staff of the Imperial Household Agency.

There was no parking lot, and it was 800 yen for 2 hours at a nearby coin parking. It was a wonderful garden surrounded by vast nature.
According to the guide, Shugakuin Imperial Villa is located in the northeastern part of Kyoto City at the foot of Mt. Hiei. It was built by the retired Emperor Gomizunoo in the early Edo period. .
On the vast grounds, there are gardens and buildings on three plateaus with different heights called the Upper Rikyu, Middle Rikyu, and Lower Rikyu. There are paddy fields (terraced rice fields) within the palace grounds, and a path lined with pine trees that crosses the paddy fields connects the three palaces. Shimo Rikyu uses a technique called “shakkei” (borrowed landscape), with the surrounding mountains serving as the backdrop to the garden, creating a magnificent view that spreads before your eyes. In the reception hall of the Churikyu, there is a shelf with a different shape called ""kasumidana"", which was innovative and beautiful at that time. Climb the pine tree-lined slope from Churikyu to Kamirikyu, which is centered on “Yokuryu Pond”. This slope was so steep that I was out of breath. From Rinun-tei, the teahouse located at the highest point in the detached palace, you can see a large Yokuryu Pond (a pond created by damming up a stream from the mountain) below, and the city of Kyoto and its surroundings behind it. You can see mountains etc. The view from here is spectacular. and walk around the pond. This pond is so vast that the emperor used to entertain guests in a two-story boat and enjoy boating. The elaborately designed stone bridge “Chitose Bridge” was built in the late Edo period during the reign of Emperor Kokaku. Then, you will reach another tea room, ""Kyokutei,"" which is located in the center of Yokuryu Pond and overlooks the pond. After that, enjoy the changing scenery of this pond and the mountains while going around the mountain and returning to the main gate. There is also a large trimming while climbing this staircase.
In spring, flowers such as cherry blossoms, rhododendrons, and azaleas decorate the garden, and in autumn, the mountains are colored in brocade, and you can feel the changing of the seasons. It was as vast and splendid as the gardens of the Palace of Versailles in France.

Shin Mukaigawa,2022-11-06 03:32:16,5,3," This is the largest place you can visit under the control of the Imperial Household Agency in Kyoto City. It's a bit inconvenient for traffic, so if you go by car, there's really no parking lot, so you parked at a nearby coin parking.
It is divided into three large sites, and there is a lot of walking and climbing, so it was tough in the middle of summer, and it seemed difficult for people with bad legs.
The view of the pond where I climbed was good and the autumn leaves were starting to be beautiful. To be honest, I didn't expect much compared to Katsura Imperial Villa, but I was able to go around comfortably because it was bigger.

すみれ,2022-11-14 07:16:31,5,2," Three months ago, I made an online reservation from the Imperial Household Agency website.
The Imperial Household Agency will guide you carefully. In the middle of November, the weather and climate were good and it was a wonderful walk. The autumn leaves of Yokuryu Pond in Kamirikyu were beautiful. The cover photo of the pamphlet was also from here.
Our group was from 9:00 to 10:15. You will be walking a lot, so comfortable shoes are recommended.
There is no goshuin, but I asked for a visit commemorative stamp. It is 500 yen.
As an aside, there is also Sekizan Zen-in Temple near Shugakuin Imperial Villa, and the autumn leaves here are also beautiful.
There are times when taxis stop in front of Shugakuin Imperial Villa, but there were none on this day, so I called the taxi company that the person in charge told me. It was 1500 yen in about 10 minutes to the next destination, Mt. Hiei cable station.

It was a visit in the light rain, but it felt like a special place and it was very good. The garden was well maintained and the autumn leaves were very beautiful. It is one of the places you want to visit once in a lifetime.

It's long and cold, so we recommend going to the restroom in the waiting room.

They waited until everyone was ready, and they used a loudspeaker with a polite explanation.
I enjoyed listening to the splendid picture of the carp and the episode of drawing a net later to prevent it from escaping.

It was a reservation from 9:00 in the morning, but we need to prepare earlier to start.
thank you in the cold
Finally, after the third time, I was able to make a reservation.
I appreciate that it's free

典子名倉,2023-01-19 22:00:31,5,0," I couldn't apply at all even if I applied online in November. Autumn leaves season is hard everywhere!
I made a reservation on the same day in January two months later.
You can take it.
The guide gave us a detailed explanation of the vast garden, scenery, history, etc. The 1 hour and 15 minute walk was a little up and down, but it went by in a blink of an eye. The well-maintained pine trees are beautiful, and from the top you can see not only Kyoto city but also Abeno Harukas. Nowadays, there are many temples that charge 1,000 yen to visit, but it is free. 🙌

jui-chen Hung,2023-02-26 10:20:20,5,1," One of the three imperial gardens in Kyoto that needs to be reserved. Take the Eizan Electric Railway to Shugakuin Station and walk for about 15 minutes. Make an appointment on the official website of the Imperial Household Agency. After the review is passed, you will receive an email notification, print it out and bring it with you. If you have a passport and report on time, you can get a free guide machine in Chinese. If you don’t get it, you have to ask for it. It seems that the staff forgot to give it to me this time. I have to remind you to give it. When the time is up, there will be staff from the Imperial Household Agency to guide the tour. The explanation is in Japanese. , but there is a guide machine, look at the number and press the button, listen to the radio commentary, it is easy and happy.

After entering inside, I found that the palace is really big. It is divided into three areas. It takes a little strength to do it. The weather was fine that day, and the scenery of the rice field garden was really beautiful! There are beautiful scenery everywhere, and countless scenic spots in Kyoto are crowded with people. This kind of point that requires reservation control, the crowds are under control, and it has a high tourist quality. It is highly recommended to arrange it in the itinerary.

山下正雄,2023-03-01 08:18:20,4,0," It's a little far from the center of Kyoto, but I went there in February. It is managed by the Imperial Household Agency and requires a postcard or online reservation, but it is attractive that it is free. The day I went was a snowy day and the scenery of the garden is rarely seen, so the guide came on a lucky day? There are some climbs and descents, and the tour takes about an hour and a half. Thank you for maintaining the passage before the tour because of the snow.

The walk is not too strenuous but be mindful that there are quite a few steps, especially around the lower and upper Villa.

We hope you too enjoy the gardens; we hope to be back and see them at different times of the year!

もといわはるまさ,2023-05-18 02:47:53,5,1," I went there at the end of summer last year.
I waited at the entrance from the early hours to get an admission ticket from 3:30 pm on the day.
There were quite a few people even on weekdays, but I managed to enter without incident.
We will walk for about 80 minutes while listening to the guide's story.
The splendid contrast of man-made objects and human-made but natural plants is simply beautiful and moving.
80 minutes goes by in a blink of an eye.
I am very grateful to be able to visit such a wonderful place for free.
I live in Kyoto, so I go to Sento Imperial Palace several times a year.
I've never been there when it's snowing, so next time I'll try to go there.
