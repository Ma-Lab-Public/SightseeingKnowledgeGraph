However, the pine branches in the garden withered in winter, which can be seen from the Daishoin, are wonderful and worth seeing.

zaucats,2018-04-29 08:37:13,5,1," Introducing the fresh green Manshuin. The path from the Imperial Envoy Gate to this approach is all green. The number of worshipers is rather small. This is because the number of tourists from overseas, who are now very large, does not reach Manju-in Temple. In the first place, because the road on the way is narrow, large buses for groups cannot enter the gate.
You can see this famous garden from the wet veranda covered with a red carpet as much as you want without being disturbed by other people. It's neither hot nor cold, it's a really nice season.

Manshu-in Temple is one of the five monzeki temples of the Tendai sect of Buddhism.

I don't know why I don't want to visit it again, probably because I wasn't particularly interested in the historical significance of this place.

The building isn't particularly spectacular, but you can see the attention to detail in the interior design. The handle of the sliding door is a gourd pattern. Since the temple was originally owned by the imperial family, there are metal fittings for the chrysanthemum gate here and there. I guess it's the fun of people who have plenty of time and money.
However, it was difficult to get there. It's far from the bus station, so it's a long walk! What's more, from the road you can see fields, bamboo groves, houses here and there, and no convenience stores or coffee shops. Not even a vending machine. Is this really Kyoto? I thought.

Manshu-in, a Buddhist temple located in Ichijoji, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, is a monzeki temple also known as Takenouchi Monzeki.
Along with Shoren-in Temple, Sanzen-in Temple, Myoho-in Temple, and Bishamondo Monzeki Temple, it is considered one of the Five Monzeki Temples in Tendai.
""Manshu"" means ""medicine"" and ""love music"" in Sanskrit.
The character for special is a little different, but it seems to be derived from `` Manjushage '', which is a cluster amaryllis.
Manjushage is also known as the ""heavenly flower"".
It seems that it is derived from the Buddhist scripture, ""As a good omen, red flowers will fall from the sky.""
The Karesansui garden in front of the Daishoin of Manshuin Temple has been designated as a national scenic spot.
The pebbles spread all over express the flow of water, and Tsurushima and Kameshima are placed in it.
This season, the green foliage was vivid, but as autumn deepens, the foliage turns vermilion and becomes a wonderfully burning garden. I think it would be nice to take a slow look from the study room. If you go further from the Shoshoin, you will reach the ‚ÄúKaminodokoro‚Äù, which is currently open to the public.

On the way to follow the viewing route, you will see the wooden statues of Gansan Daishi, an important cultural property.

It is easy to imagine that the plum blossoms, the autumn leaves are still outstanding. It is a temple of the Tendai sect that originated from the first monastery built by Saicho on Mt. It is a temple where children are the head of the temple for generations, and this temple started in the 4th year of the Ming Dynasty (1495) when the prince of the Fushiminomiya family, the high priest, acquired it. Since Korekokushi, the first monk of the temple, was from the Sugawara family, it has a deep relationship with Kitano Tenmangu Shrine, which enshrines Sugawara no Michizane as a deity. After several relocations, it was moved to its current location in 1656, in the early Edo period, by Cloistered Imperial Prince Ryoichi, who served as Tendai (the highest rank of the Tendai sect). At his father's palace, he excels in landscaping the tea ceremony, and beauty can be seen everywhere in the building and the garden, such as the metal fittings of the Daishoin Koshoin (both important cultural properties). It is enshrined, and there are eight tea houses (important cultural properties) to the north of Shoshoin. Currently entrusted to the Kyoto National Museum

„Åü„Åë„Åª„Åå„Çâ,2022-05-15 12:12:05,4,6," I got off at Ichijoji Station on the Eizan Electric Railway and used Google Maps to reach Manshuin Monzeki.

This temple seems to have a very close relationship with the imperial family. Here and there are pictures of the current retired emperor visiting here with the empress when he was still emperor. According to Wikipedia, ""monzeki"" means ""a specific temple where the imperial family or court nobles serve as chief priests.""

It was a tough place to take pictures. No inside the building, no outside garden from inside the building, no outside garden from the red carpet on the porch. So I took a picture of the garden as the main one.

Also, I couldn't go out of the building (garden), and when I looked at the pamphlet, there were important cultural properties such as the Kuri, Daishoin, and Koshoin, but I was disappointed that I couldn't take pictures. I was only able to take pictures of the imperial envoy gate (no entry) and the side gate from outside the premises.

This time we came during the season of green maple leaves, but you will surely be able to see the colorful garden during the fall foliage season.

Originally, the entrance was from the garden, and there is a shelf for placing swords at the entrance.
The shelf can also be seen from the public viewing area if the location is known.

After entering the building, we especially recommend the tiger paintings in the ""Tiger Room"".
The tiger walking triumphantly with the pudding and the buttocks out was very cute.
In addition, the Mt. Fuji-shaped nail cover and the chrysanthemum transom in the ""Fuji-no-ma"" were wonderful because they felt playful.

From today, the national treasure Huang Fudo Myoo is open to the public
So first thing in the morning
Arrive at the entrance 3 minutes before the opening time
Six people were already lined up.
The Shinden is also being rebuilt for the first time in 150 years.
It seems that there will be a memorial service next week
I turned around along the route
I can't find the yellow fudo myoo I'm looking for
I came back to the original entrance
that? go around again

No, but you said you were opening the book side by side, right?
this is gonna happen
So, I came back to the entrance again.
When I asked at the reception, the woman in charge of temple affairs was also uncertain.
I checked with the chief priest who was sweeping the garden.
It is said that it will be exhibited in the Shinden.
Turn around again to Shinden
I stayed quietly in the back of the upper side
Did you do Kyobo? Restoration originals and copies deposited
two lined up
Everyone passed by without noticing
If I sit on my knees in front of the two widths and recite the mantra of Fudo Myoo
I stood up more and more after
Are you worried about your job?
I came to take a peek
An exhibition that doesn't have any rituals
I'm surprised by that surprise
In such a way, I was able to pray in silence.
