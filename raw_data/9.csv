府城古,2018-04-25 14:12:51,5,2," ""Arashiyama Sagano Train"" is famous all over the world, and it is a golden route for viewing maple leaves and cherry blossoms!

It is really difficult to book the Arashiyama Sagano train during the peak season of maple viewing.

If you buy five-seat tickets for the scenic ""Even Number"" starting from the first stop ""トロッコ Saga"" at 09:07 during the golden hour, you don't have to wait in line!

When the ""Sagano Sightseeing Train"" was approaching the terminal, an announcement sounded in the carriage, and the announcement in Chinese emphasized thank you ""passenger from Taiwan"".

This little train is used by people from many different countries, including the United States, France, and Chinese. How can it be so friendly to Taiwan? Although I was a little puzzled, I still laughed happily when I heard this kind of broadcast!

Foreign tourists visiting Japan, please try to get out of Kyoto because this city offers subpar service by Japanese standard.

My experience at this station is an example. At 2:15pm I asked for three tickets. The women at the window said only standing tickets were available for 3:05 but seatings were available for 4:05. I said let me check with my family but before I left, she said sorry 3:05 just sold out. I talked to my family for 2 minutes and returned to her to buy three 4:05 tickets. I asked for 4:05 specifically and she quickly pointed the 4:05 in the schedule and I said yes. She confirmed the seating arrangements with me but did not point out to me that she actually sold me three 3:05 tickets. I guess someone cancelled in that two minutes. I was under the impression that I’m buying 4:05 tickets and did not expect them to be 3:05 because she told me 3:05 are out and crossed out that 3:05 in the schedule in front of me.

my family killed almost two hours of time wandering around because we were waiting for our train and to my surprise, I found out they are for 3:05. I checked with her but she did not admit I asked to buy a 4:05 tickets and insisted even tho there are availabilities for the 4:05 right before departure I had to repurchase tickets. She even claimed because my receipts said 2:18, she was telling me the 2:05 tickets were out when I first asked her, which is a complete lie. Why would I care about 2:05 tickets when it was 2:18? I admit I didn’t double check the time on the tickets but the fact that she made such a bad excuse to get out of her responsibility was so low and ugly and so not Japanese standard.

She clearly did not care she ruined several hours of our time traveling in Japan and did not care to make it up for us even though she could have. All she cared was to lie to make ridiculous excuse for her poor service and carelessness.

Never again, Kyoto. Seriously, this city is not the true Japan. You can find better food, service, people or scenery is any other city in Japan.",no,,view review

This train is with open window, hence with wind chill, it can get pretty cold. One way ticket from JR west is 630yen. But it can be difficult to get during peak season. Either book early or get the ticket from an agent online. (it can cost you as much as double the price). I would suggest to take 1 way scenic train will do. Take normal JR train for the other way. It  is a 10 mins walk at the kameoka side. There is nothing mutch at kameoka town. So don't suggest to spend time there. If you take the kameoka to arashiyama scenic train, you can choose to stop at Torokko arashiyama stn and visit the bamboo groove. Taking the standing ticket for the scenic train is not too bad an idea as there are at both sides of the train. It is not too bad an experience especially during the foliage season.",no,,view review

The trolley train itself can be enjoyed depending on the season and weather.
If Arashiyama Station is the starting point, there are plenty of highlights on the left side in the first half of the operation and on the right side in the second half of both the outbound and return trips. However, seats cannot be selected.
At Torokko Arashiyama Station, you can also purchase a ticket for the Hozugawa River Boat Ride (at a separate window). There are plenty of shops, so you don't have to worry about killing time, from buying tickets to boarding.
The response of the station is two stars, and the station facilities and the trolley train itself are four stars.

It is really necessary to buy trains with different upper and lower trains in advance, otherwise it is said that sometimes you buy in the wrong direction, and it will be difficult to buy again. .

The official route is to walk up from Arashiyama, but if you go to JR Mabori, transfer to Torokko Kameoka, and get off at this station, you can go sightseeing all the way to Arashiyama without sweating.
Rich is recommended for the trolley train. Luckily I was able to make a reservation, so I was able to enjoy Arashiyama while feeling the wind.

There are tea shops and chairs in front of the station, so it's a good place to take a break.

The bamboo grove was also worth seeing.

Tanuki are lined up at the last station. The surrounding area is surrounded by fields and nothing.

Tickets for peak seasons such as autumn foliage were lined up in a huge line, so we recommend making advance reservations online (e5489) in advance!

By the way, I actually didn't get on from this station,
I got on from the other terminal, Torokko Kameoka, so this was the arrival point!

Because the tickets for the trolley from here to Kameoka sold out faster,
It was easier to get from Kameoka.

With this as the final stop for the trolley (note: it's not the final stop!), the route from the bamboo grove to Tenryu-ji Temple, shopping and sweets in the Arashiyama area, and then returning to Kyoto city was the right choice!

朱伯駿,2022-08-05 00:32:18,5,5," Taking Sagano Romantic Train is one classical itinerary of Arashiyama maple journey. On the train route, people will see the scenic beauty of well-spaced maple trees on Hozukyo Ravine's side (Hozugawa).

In general, tourists would take JR line from Kyoto (京都) station to Umahori (马姬) Station, then walk to the Kameoka torokko (阁冈) station and take Sagano train to Arashiyama (鲜山) station for autumn maple scene in Arashuyama ( Arashiyama). It's about 25-30 mins for this train journey.

For Taiwanese, train tickets can be ordered through KKDAY within one month before departure. The scenery facing the river is nice from seats in ""double number"". Or people can only order it from JR Green Window as they arrive in Japan. I recommend buying tickets before going to Japan or you might buy it on the departure day by luck. If the fifth car is available, try to move there for the best view.

Taking the Sagano Sightseeing Train is one of Arashiyama's maple viewing itineraries. Along the way, you can see the scenery of the Hozu River and the maple trees on both sides. It is so beautiful.
It is generally recommended to take the JR Sanin Main Line from Kyoto Station to Mabori Station, then walk from Mabori to Kameoka Station, take a small train to Arashiyama Station and enter Arashiyama scenic spots to enjoy the maple leaves. The drive takes about half an hour.
On KKDAY online, you can book small train tickets first. ""Even-numbered"" seats can see more scenery (facing the river); or book tickets at the JR green window after arriving in Japan. It is recommended to book tickets first, otherwise you can only gamble on the day to see if you can buy a ticket on the day. If there is a fifth car, you can try to move there, the scenery is the best.

Ting Ting,2022-10-14 10:18:39,4,0,"Sagano Romantic Train is an old fashion train ride that travels at a relatively slow pace providing passengers with a relaxing view of the forest and Arashiyama river.

The experience is enjoyable as the train travels from the district of Arashiyama through the serene forest and mountains into the rural of Kameoka city.

The entire ride was relatively short (approximately 25 minutes for one way) and it would have been nice if the ride could be longer for the price paid.

KK,2022-11-17 23:10:35,5,0," I went in late October. It was a weekend and it was so crowded that I couldn't get on the Rich, but I had a lot of fun with a regular car. I got to the end and turned around. Both the right and left sides have great views. The conductor's in-car announcement and song were also good.

tako,2022-11-19 01:39:34,4,0," Booked at e5489 from 10:00 a month ago. Accounting with a credit card.
Tickets are issued on the day before at the green ticket vending machine at the JR station.
¥880 one way
On the day of the event, it was crowded with people standing to watch.
Torokko Saga Station is right in front of JR Saga Arashiyama Station.
Show your ticket and board. Reserved seat.
Rich seats are recommended. The price remains the same.
Autumn leaves along the Hozu River seen from the window.
Go through the tunnel.
The speed is faster than I expected, and the camera shakes. .
You can't specify a seat unless you're in Kansai.
The leaves on the other side were more advanced than the seat where I was. . .
Going to Kameoka and going down the Hozu River might be the best. It takes more than 4000, but...!
On the train on the way back, the staff will take pictures and sell them for you.

The train ride was 20 mins and follows the river. Tickets were sold out so do purchase in advance for peak seasons. Definitely a visit if you are here!

Y Sze,2022-11-30 15:13:25,5,1,"It’s a must for those who visit arashiyama especially during autumn.

A relatively short ride which takes around 25min but still enjoyable. Along the route you would experience the nature according to the season, the autumn view was stunning

Recommend to book “rich” car no.5 with no windows to enjoy a better view.
Please try to book online one month in advance as it can be hard to get one in person on that day, long line there even you go early.

Also enthusiastic staff wave you off from the station, quite a unique experience in Japan.

I entered the Torokko Arashiyama station at the foot of Mt. Ogura, and asked.
""All the seats are full, but are there any free seats?""
(All seats are reserved by advance reservation purchase)
""If it's okay at 3:05 after this, there's a cancellation just now... Is that okay?
Well, it's also a 10 minute waiting time😆

To Kameoka station, the vehicle with the students on the school excursion. The conductor also provides guidance and even sings, and the clapping reminds me of school trips in the Showa era, when there was no karaoke.

On the way back, car No. 5 (a really simple trolley car) is a Taiwanese traveler's car. Some people take pictures. How nostalgic in this digital age!

By the way, 880 yen for 25 minutes one way
, 1 minute stop at Hozukyo Station on the way, Hozu River down the river is 4100 yen. When we pass each other, we wave our hands, this is our mutual promise✋

The arrival station is Sagano Station. Customers are lined up here too.
I didn't know there was such a way to enjoy Arashiyama. Families, couples, school trips, all are sure to be unforgettable memories ✌️

RK Hill,2022-12-05 10:52:57,3,0,"Perhaps, during the old days when it was the main train line, it was a pleasant ride. But now, as a tourist attraction, it wasn’t very impressive even at the height of autumn leaves season.",no,,view review
Rickover Lee,2022-12-08 21:41:54,5,6," After passing through the bamboo tunnel of Arashiyama's bamboo grove, a small train station appears in the mountains. Tickets can also be purchased on-site, but we recommend that you make a reservation before coming. Enter the station and go down some steep steps to the platform. There is no safety device such as a screen door, so be sure to pay attention to safety when accompanying children.
The view from the platform at the bottom of the valley is quite beautiful, but the Hozu River Gorge seen from the trolley train going through the tunnel is truly spectacular.
For reference, it does not operate every Wednesday except during the peak season (cherry blossom season, autumn leaves season), and does not operate at all during the winter season, so it is essential to check online in advance.

Recommend to take the train to ""Umahori Station(马杨駅)"", then walk to ""トロッコ亀冈駅"" to take a sightseeing train, and get to this station ""トロッコ井山駅"".
After getting off the train, you can walk slowly along the beautiful scenery and take pictures. Then there is no time pressure for sightseeing train, there are many beautiful scenery in this area to take pictures.

今日のわんこ,2023-03-31 10:07:21,4,0," I rode in the autumn leaves season
It was neither hot nor cold, it was comfortable, and the conductor's light-hearted talk was interesting.
Unfortunately, due to the typhoon, trees fell and there were places where the surface of the mountain was visible, but there were tunnels and rivers, so I was busy with many things to see.

The people on the Hozu River rafting wave their hands and look back at us too... I thought rafting would be fun, but the other day there was a tragic accident.
Once I calm down, I feel like I want to ride, and I feel a little scared...

I originally planned to travel with my family on the small train in Arashiyama. I booked 3 tickets on the same day on the online platform starting with 2k, but I was informed that only one ticket was booked. I wanted to cancel and ask for a refund, but 2K refused to refund the ticket. The money for the ticket turned out to be a person riding the small train alone, very helpless...

There is a location marker on the JR Sagano Line, but it is not a JR station. I thought that I could go back to Kyoto Station from here by train, so I went there and turned back on foot.
Please note that the location of the marker is the ticket office for the trolley train, not the JR station.

Johnny Peralta,2023-05-16 06:27:50,4,1," Note for ticket purchase:
It is recommended to book tickets first. Tickets can be purchased directly on the spot on weekdays, but there are quite a lot of people. Buy tickets in advance to avoid overcrowding
After Klook purchases the ticket and collects the voucher, it can be displayed directly at the ticket gate ""no need to change the ticket""
Tickets purchased from the JR official website need to be exchanged at the JR station. Please change the ticket before going to the small train station.

Suggested itinerary:
Tickets will be voided if the scheduled time is not reached, please arrive early.
If you buy a one-way ticket, you can walk from the terminal to another station, and you will not return to Arashiyama. It is recommended to arrange time to visit Arashiyama first, and finally take a small train to leave. The nearby streets have a Japanese-style country style, and there is a beautiful view of Arashiyama a little further away. It is worth it visit.

Travel experience:
The scenery is beautiful, close to the scenery of the mountains in eastern Taiwan, it is considered a small scenic spot, it is recommended to stay for 1-2 hours

Bella Wu,2023-05-27 01:51:47,4,0," It is very recommended to go one-way. If you buy a round-trip ticket, don’t get off the bus. We just didn’t realize that we missed the train completely. We were really defeated by ourselves. We would suggest to come again when there is a flower season, it will be very beautiful
