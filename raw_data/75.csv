Trans-word plus TGM,2016-07-29 01:19:47,4,2,"Toyokuni Shrine is a Shinto shrine located in Higashiyama-ku. It was built in 1599 to commemorate Toyotomi Hideyoshi who was one of the 3 greatest unifiers of Warring States Period of Japan. It is the location of the first tamaya ( a Shinto altar for ancestor worship ) ever constructed, which was later destroyed by the Tokugawa clan to forbid the worship of Toyotomi.

This shrine is the official tomb and shrine of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who died in 1598 in Kyoto.

Nobles, priests, warriors, and townspeople gathered at the shrine to celebrate the anniversary of Hideyoshi's apotheosis  Á•û„Å®„Åó„Å¶Á•Ä„Çã„Åì„Å®„ÄÄwith banquets, musical recitals, and boisterous festivity. The shrine was closed by Tokugawa Ieyasu in June 1615 ""to discourage these unseemly displays of loyalty to a man he had eclipsed.""

The Meiji Emperor directed that the shrine be restored in 1868. In 1897, the tercentenary  ÔºìÔºêÔºêÂπ¥Ë®òÂøµ  of Hideyoshi was celebrated at this site.

July 29, 2019 Kyoto early summer trip

It is Toyokuni Shrine that enshrines Toyotomi Hideyoshi.
After the fall of the Toyotomi family, it was abolished by Ieyasu's order, but it has a history of being revived by Emperor Meiji's imperial order!

It is a bell with the famous story of ""National peace and well-being"" written on it, so Ieyasu's name was snipped off and it was called Ichamon.
If you pay 300 yen at the shrine office and buy an admission ticket for the Treasure Hall, you can also get a simple pamphlet.
The Mausoleum of Toyokuni is located at the top of the mountain at the end of the slope to the east of the Kyoto National Museum, so I think it would be good to go there as well.
You can climb Toyokuni Mausoleum by putting 100 yen in a box, but it is recommended to pay 100 yen at the shop and listen to the story of Uncle Toyokuni Mausoleum before climbing.

‰∏ÉÈù¢È≥•ÊîæÊµ™Ë®ò,2020-11-25 09:04:17,3,2," The National Treasure Karamon Gate is majestic enough, but it is clearly floating in the precincts, which is almost like a parking lot. It's a pity because the shrine building seen from the ruins of the Great Buddha Hall of Hokoji Temple is splendid in its own way, and the precincts of the temple can be greatly enhanced depending on how it is presented. The feeling of treasure is whether or not there is an eye-catching treasure on display. Miyajima's Itsukushima Shrine reminds us of the prosperity of the Heike clan, but Toyokuni Shrine makes us feel the decline of the Toyotomi clan. It is said that there used to be the precincts of Toyokuni Shrine up to around Chishaku-in, but now there is no trace of it.

Sanjusangendo Temple, Chishakuin Temple, and the National Museum are nearby, so I think it's a good shrine to drop by without expecting too much.

After the fall of the Toyotomi clan, it fell into disrepair, but in the first year of the Meiji era, the Kaguraden of Shin-Hiyoshi Jingu was rebuilt as a temporary main hall, and a new shrine was built on the grounds of the former Great Buddha Hall of Hokoji Temple. The Karamon Gate, a National Treasure, is said to be the remains of Fushimi Castle, and was moved from Nijo Castle to Nanzenji Temple's Konchiin Temple. I'm here.

The Shoin and Treasure Museum, which are usually closed to the public, are open to the public, and the real Kotsubami Toshiro, which is owned by the National Museum, is open to the public for the first time in 30 years. In the study, you can see the folding screen (replica) of the Toyokuni Festival up close, and the hanging scroll written by Hideyori himself is also a highlight. In the treasure hall, specialties related to Hideyoshi are lined up, and you can study. And above all, the real body of Toshiro Kotsubami and a copy of the sword are displayed side by side, which is impressive enough. It is worth mentioning that photography is free in both the treasure hall and the study hall, so it is irresistible for camera lovers.

There is also Mimizuka, which was a memorial tower for the dispatch of troops to Korea, and Horsemound, which is said to have been moved by people who admired Hideyoshi after the former Toyokuni Shrine was demolished.
In the back of the building, there is a museum called Treasure Museum, which displays items related to Hideyoshi. (Admission 300 yen)

Toyotomi is respected and admired by the Japanese, but is a person who gave Koreans the deep pain of war.
It is a history of hundreds of years in the past, but standing in front of the ear tomb at the present moment makes me think about the importance of the country once again.

King Seonjo was the first to flee from the capital, Hanyang.
President Syngman Rhee abandoned Seoul, the capital, and blew up the Hangang Bridge and fled alone.

The Karamon, a national treasure, is said to have been relocated from Fushimi Castle.

Within the precincts, there is also Sessha Teiteru Shrine, which enshrines Hideyoshi's wife Kita no Mandokoro.

There is a rare Sennari gourd ema named after Hideyoshi's horse mark. Write a wish on the ema and dedicate it to Karamon. The gourd-shaped ema is very impressive.

In front of the Karamon gate, there is another lucky white tiger. The zebra-patterned tiger is said to bring good fortuneüêÖIt seems that local university students made it in hopes of the end of the corona virus.

After writing your wish on the gourd-shaped ema, put it in a white paper bag along with 500 yen and post it. Care should be taken to post without tying.

For nearly 260 years, from the fall of the Toyotomi clan to the end of the Tokugawa regime, we were put in an unfortunate position, but there are still people who are watching.

There is a magnificent display of armor on display.
You can see it up close through the glass case.
I was able to experience the dreadfulness of weapons that people wear and risk their lives that cannot be conveyed in books.

Sanjusangendo is also about a 5-minute walk away.

The treasure hall is not a big deal.
Right next to it is the famous big bell of Hokoji Temple.
More than that, the vastness of the main street, which remains wide from the front of the shrine to the ear mound, reminds me of the former splendor, which makes me sad.

Is there a parking lot but is it free? Bikes were free, but I don't know cars.

There was also a bell tower that triggered the Osaka Winter Siege at [Hokoji], a temple right next to it.

In the treasure hall, there were many small but valuable items such as [Hideyoshi's molar] and [used pillow].

It was a year-end visit, but there were surprisingly few people, so I was able to look around slowly.
It is considered to be one of the fortune tours, so this time I would like to bring a red stamp.

- S,2023-04-05 14:33:22,4,0," Although it is near Kiyomizu-dera Temple and Sanjusangendo Temple, it is sparsely visited and quiet. The gate to the inner shrine is closed, so you can't visit it, but I think it's worth seeing the construction of the gate and stone lanterns.

If you go through the torii gate and turn left, you will find Hokoji Temple. There are the bells of ""National Anxiety"" and ""Reverend and Honorable"". Let's take a look at this as well.

I used to be able to touch it, but it seems that there were many people who were not polite, so now I just look at it.
However, the New Year's bell can also be played by the general public. You have to be in line by 11pm.
