Benedict Uy,2017-02-16 01:32:14,5,2,"This temple is known for its 1000 Kannon statues. The wooden sculptures were all carved by hand and each one looks slightly different even though they all had the same items in each of their hands. There is also the main larger statue in the middle of all the smaller ones. Apart from the Kannon there were also statues of the other deities with English descriptions.
You need to take off your shoes but they provide bags for you to carry it around.
The grounds outside is quite nice, with a pond and shrine around the ground.
It is a bit out of the way but you can catch a bus to get here and it is quite a sight to behold.

Edward T,2017-03-04 10:20:23,5,2,"Magnificent. Easy access from Kyoto station by bus. Purchase a day pass of ¬•500 and you can visit a few places in Kyoto. Bus 100, 206, 208 from Kyoto station will take you there. Alight at Shichi-jo dori and follow the sign board to the entrance of Sanjusangen-do.

Sanjusangen-do is a Buddhist temple at Higashiyama district of Kyoto. Officially known as 'Rengeo-in', it means hall of lotus king. The name of the temple refers to Hall with thirty three space between columns, reflects the architectural construction. It houses thousand armed Kannon Statues made of Japanese cypress clad with gold leaf.

A must-see temple when you are in Kyoto.

From the same bus stop you may continue to take the bus to Kiyomizu-dera.

Don Vittorio,2017-03-29 00:35:19,4,2,"This shrine is a smaller area and the outside ground is not so impressive. But it is a large open area and good for taking photos. There are sakura trees and if you are lucky they are in bloom when you visit.
The main beauty of this shrine is inside the main building. It is one of the most impressive and striking displays I've seen. Thousands of golden Buddha statues. It is such a peaceful and powerful place to visit and experience. You can feel the history. They have English descriptions of the different deities on display. Unfortunately photography inside the building is prohibited. But you must visit here.

Luke Phang,2017-04-10 12:31:24,4,1,"I didn't know why we decided to visit this place, but I guess it's because they have 1001 statues of Buddha in this long hall. Other than that there's nothing much, but staring into 1001 statues of Buddha can be quite an experience. I felt awed at the sheer number of the statues but if you're not someone who can appreciate works of art and labour then you might want to skip this place. It's not that easy to reach and there's are not many other attractions around this place.

There were food stalls on the temple grounds which made it very festive. Normally this is a quiet temple with a beautiful pond area surrounded by cherry blossom trees (gorgeous during cherry blossom season). We were able to see the last archers and were given free entrance to the temple. We saw the 1,000 statues which is very neat to see all the different faces. The monks were also given blessings over anyone who came through to remove evil and provide healing, especially for headaches. It was a great experience overall.

The Kawazu sakura flowers‚Äô outstanding characteristic is that they are large and pink. When the trees are in peak bloom, they look brilliant.The main sakura tree in the garden near the pond had already developed some green leaves. Still, it was a worthwhile visit.

""33"" is in Japanese Sanjusan. Sanjusangendo is called so because this temple is a hall with thirty-three spaces between columns. The official name of Sanjusangendo is Rengeoin temple.
In front of the temple hall, there is Natural Springs for Worshippers. This is called night sobbing springs because the flow of the spring sounds like a person sobbing. On the other hand, it is said that visiting this spring helps to stop babies crying at night.
The hall of the temple is about 120 meter long. The gallery on the western side of the hall is famous for the annual Toshiya Festival (canceled this year). Archers shoot arrows the length of the hall. It seems so difficult to hit the target!
This temple houses 1001 statues of the 1000-armed Kannon (Buddhist deity). The largest seated Kannon is National Treasure, and is flanked on either side by 500 smaller Kannon images, nearly lined up in rows.  It is said that there is one statue whose face is just like you, and if you find the statue, you have good luck!
