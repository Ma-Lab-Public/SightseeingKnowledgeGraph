Booth owners seem to be buying antiques from Japan, France, Belgium, England, etc., and selling them here. It's not cheap enough to buy at this flea market and sell elsewhere, but rather for those who want to buy one for themselves.

On this day, go to the National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto

""Discovered Landscapes of Japan""
In the Meiji era, (professional) painters who visited Japan from foreign countries painted the scenery of that side of Japan.
Japanese people want to start drawing Japanese (everyday) scenery with that as an opportunity.

In a large number of paintings
Familiar shrines and temples, Mt. Fuji, the sea, flowers, and the sky are drawn,
The difference is that the people there are Meiji people
Everyone wore kimonos, some had loincloths, their hair was tied up, they had topknots...

There are no buildings, but houses with thatched roofs and boards,
A ship is a sailing vessel, a wooden vessel like a boat
just a wide sea

In the scenery that should be familiar
Overcoming the sense of incongruity that Meiji people exist
When I think that one day I will be in that kind of situation, I have mixed feelings.

If you don't live in the present...
(If you can live normally) in a few decades
I want to be able to reach a peaceful end

Noriko,2021-11-12 12:28:19,5,6," I went to the antique market on the 10th of every month. Although it is called Heian flea market (flea market), it is not a flea market. This is an antique market where only shops with licenses for secondhand dealers are allowed. I don't feel like I can find bargains like Toji's antique market, but overall, there are many young shop owners and a young customer base, so I prefer Western and Showa vintage antiques to Edo period and medieval antiques. I feel that there are many shops.
It is convenient because there is a Starbucks next to it.
The surrounding area is dotted with delicious restaurants, so it was nice to be able to have lunch on the way home.
I couldn't find a designated bicycle parking place, so I parked my bicycle illegally at the entrance like everyone else.

momo momo,2023-03-25 09:09:07,5,3," Rather than a historical zone, it is a cultural zone that has long been enjoyed on holidays. Okazaki Park has all kinds of cultural facilities, including Heian Jingu Shrine, grounds, concert halls, zoos, museums, libraries, trade fair halls, large municipal parking lots, children's parks, police boxes, and public toilets.

There are also restaurants, galleries, shrines and temples, a historical sightseeing zone, various cultural halls, etc. in the surrounding area, so you can always enjoy using it regardless of age or composition.

There are also many open-air markets, events and exhibitions. Starbucks is in the ROHM Theater next to the park, so it's really helpful to be able to take a coffee break with your pet.

Municipal parking lots do not have maximum charges on holidays. In the case of holiday use, I think that it is good to think that it is about 500 yen per hour.
By the way, the entrance to this municipal parking lot is to go east from the west side of Nijo-dori, and enter the left-hand side road that branches off from the intersection of Jingu-michi and goes down to the basement.
This intrusion road is not recognized as a roadway, and people may walk in front of it like a sidewalk, so be careful.
