Lin W,2017-11-02 18:19:57,5,3,"So far, this is the only temple in Kyoto that I find truly exemplifies what a temple should be like, tranquil, serene, peaceful and old. It's not flashy and not commercialized. The architecture is absolutely what you would imagine a  traditional buddhist temple should be like. Beautiful scenery, nice, quiet, and awesome buildings with architecture that can withstand thousands of years.

My favorite temple in Kyoto if not the entire Japan.

Bert Kimura,2017-11-27 14:18:20,5,0,"One of the best temple complexes to visit in Kyoto. Historic and a UNESCO World Heritage site. Best in Fall (Japanese maple or momiji) or in Spring (cherry blossoms). Spacious but crowded at these times. Nearby subtemples ($) are worthy of visits along with the Abbott's quarters. There is no charge for entry to the grounds surrounding the main gate (Sanmon). Easily accessible by walking from the Philosopher's Path or vice versa.

The grounds of the complex  are beautiful and if you can come early in the morning before the crowds, you can easily have the whole place to yourself. There are many hiking trails and paths connecting with some of the other temples in the neighborhood, as well as with the hiking trail that goes around Kyoto. This is definitely one of the places to visit in Kyoto!

A saying goes by a moment of prayer in ÂçóÁ¶ÖÂØ∫ worthy of a year of well wishing. Aside from being off-the-tourist radar, the temple full of presence in calm and tranquility. Never been feeling so spiritually and mentally connected to the force of Zen.

If you are looking for a relaxing experience, I would not recommend visiting during cherry blossom season. It was very crowded around Nanzenji Temple.

Located within the Nanzenjifukuchicho temple, it‚Äôs an aqueduct built in ancient Roman architecture styling and a short stroll away from the main temple structure. It‚Äôs defunct now n the remains are purely for viewing. It‚Äôs a serene area, moss covered n lush with vegetation. Together with the tall trees, cool temperatures and a small stream of water that provides a truly scenic spot for quiet contemplation. The area has clearly been conserved n maintained and much of the original look has been preserved. It‚Äôs a unique structure to find in a forested area at a Japanese Zen Temple site but truly a gem, well worth a closer examination. Well recommendedüëç

Fl√°via Giomo,2019-09-11 11:10:49,5,0,"Kyoto is impressive, and so the Nanzenji Temple.
Take time to visit it, and enjoy the silent and zen atmosphere.
Whenever visiting Kyoto, make sure you wear confy shoes... you will have a lot of walk, and on the zen temples you need to take your shoes off before entering it. Which is quite relaxing to walk on bare feet on wood floor.
Nanzenji is one of the must go places in Kyoto.
The Sanmon gate also in the same compound is impressive. Go all the way to the top, you will watch the city, and you will have a little view of the buildings on the compound that are not open for tourists, maybe were the monges enjoy their day? Who knows?

The aqueduct is also cool for instagram pictures.

At Nanzen-ji we chose to pay to go up into the gate and had stunning views. The stairs into the upper deck of the gate are very steep, but there are adequate handrails.

It's a large open space and the level of commitment, patience and discipline to pick up every leaf and branch and then re-rake and re-shape that entire space on a daily basis is nothing short of remarkable and inspiring.

Gunnar Caya,2023-05-18 02:38:37,5,0,"The temple and the grounds in general are really nice. The main gates and halls are nice, but pretty typical of other temples in Kyoto.

What sets this temple apart is the fact that if you stray a little bit outside of the main temple area, you can see some pretty unique scenery. A small aqueduct carrying water, a ton of trees, and a hill with a small pagoda up top, connected to forest trails that are scenic (and have monkeys if you're into that).

The garden here is decent, though 400 yen is a lot for what there is to see. You can also climb the steps of the gate for an even higher fee to get views of the surrounding area. But even if you decide not to spend any money, you can still see some really cool scenery here. I'd highly recommend seeing this in conjunction with the Higashiyama Jisho-ji/Ginkakuji Temple and walking from one to the other along the Philosopher's Path

Liisa Stenberg,2023-05-29 14:14:19,5,0,"Huge temple area with lots and lots to see. Be sure to visit the main gate from where you can see nicely around the area and the view over the city. The main hall is also worth a see: there are interesting buildings and you get to wander around the temple corridors filled with beautiful art. I recommed a visit on a weekday, so it is not too crowded.
