Enshrined deities are Wake no Kiyomaro who prevented a famous political conspiracy of Dokyo and devoted himself to developing the foundation of the Heian-kyo capital with his older sister Wake no Hiromushi. Originally Wake no Kiyomaro was enshrined at the location of Jingo-ji Temple on Mt. Takao, but later was relocated to the current site by the order of the Emperor Meiji in 1886. It enshrines the deity of legs. The legend says that when Kiyomaro met difficulties on the way to Usa Hachiman, 300 boars appeared and helped him travel to the destination, and his legs were cured. Therefore many people who wish to have healthy legs visit this shrine, including professional athletes. Sacred karin (quince) tree grows in the locality.  It is said that karin wine is made from the fruit that brings a benefit of relieving asthma. At the Inoko Festival, court events are reenacted.

It is a shrine that enshrines Prince Wake no Kiyomaro and his older sister, Princess Hiromushi, and is called Inoshishi Shrine, just like Go'o Shrines all over Japan. It is said to bring benefits for the health of the legs and the recovery from illness, and it is also said that there is a benefit for child rearing, since Princess Hiromushi took care of an orphan in Kyoto. In November, the Boar's Child Festival is held. It is also famous that this deity was enshrined on the Imperial Japanese Navy cruiser Takao. You can get a goshuin at the shrine office.

Due to the tyranny of the monk Dokyo, Kiyomaro was protected by a herd of wild boars when he fled from Kyoto to Oita, so he was protected by wild boars instead of Komainu. Because of this, various things related to wild boars are collected all over the country. By the way, my zodiac sign is a boar, but I was surprised to receive a souvenir when I offered it.

Â±±Áî∞Êñ∞‰∫î,2023-02-21 22:40:00,5,0," The god here is the god of legs. I also have bad legs, and there are trees here and there made of wild boar trees. I've been getting good results from stuffed giant trees and deer while visiting.
As long as I can walk without returning to the original, there is nothing that can beat this. I can't walk all day every day, so I'm getting benefits just by visiting the shrine like this.
I have nothing but gratitude
Thank you.
People with chronic diseases in their legs and lower back
Go'o Shrine is also advertised on TV and is popular in the middle and middle, and I am also the result
Good and worth going
Everywhere in shrines and temples
Yes. Rub the root of the tree once Rub it on your bad legs Rub this once
try it.
Even if you don't get results right away, you'll definitely turn in the right direction
Giant trees were even better.
It seems that God can come down from the top of the big tree that grows straight. The shrine here is good. Please go there once.
It's worth it.

Ëê¨‰∫∫Êïµ,2023-03-02 19:50:30,4,1," The shrine is located on the west side of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, not too far from the subway station. The scope of the shrine is small, and it can be visited within about 10 to 20 minutes. The mascot of the shrine is a wild boar, so the shrine is full of various decorations related to wild boars, even the souvenirs sold by the shrine are quite interesting shrines.

ayu je,2023-03-06 03:15:39,5,1," I went to Go'o Shrine because I heard that there is a benefit for legs and lower back.
There are wild boars in various places in this shrine called ""Wild Boar Shrine"".
It is said that if you stroke the nose of the wild boar statue in the chozuya, which is called the ""spirit of good luck,"" happiness will come to you. It is very cute to see water coming out of the boar's mouth and the colorful wild boars lined up.

I prayed for the recovery of my leg injury at the Shokon Tree's ""Monument of recovery from dyslexia"" and prayed with ""Zatateigushi"".
Another thing is that I was told to enshrine it at a higher position than my line of sight on the kamidana or the entrance.
The fortune slip inside the boar's belly is cute.

Next time, my foot injury is healed and I'm thinking of going to thank you.

There were many kinds of amulets. There were amulets for legs only, amulets for waist only, and amulets for both legs. He explained everything carefully and helped me make a choice. I want to stop by again when I go nearby.

Komaino was also strange, and there were pictures of wild boars and lucky charms here and there.

„ÅΩ„ÅÆ„Åø,2023-04-15 05:32:12,5,2," I learned from the media that there was Komaino, and as someone born in the year of the pig, I really wanted to go there.
Wake no Kiyomaro, who contributed to the relocation of the capital to Heian-kyo, is enshrined here.
Not only Komaino boars, but also wild boars in the chozuya, where there is water originally...There are many shrines with floating flowers, but it was interesting to see small wild boars tightly packed. Ema is also a boar.
People born in the Year of the Boar received a mini ema as a gift.
A lot of wild boar figurines and stuffed animals were lined up next to the entrance of the shrine office.
Behind the main hall, there is a stone to pray for the health of the legs.
The picture of the vending machine is also a boar.
Also, there was the biggest pebble in Japan. It was lined up with the statue of Wake no Kiyomaro in the back, which is not conspicuous.

There are also benefits of home safety, prosperous business, and traffic safety.
