The hike is enough to make you breathe hard but rewarding with many shrines along the way.  The temple itself is lovely,  perched in the trees,  Vermillion on green. I would really highly recommend the Karuma Onsen around the corner afterwards, a geothermally heated outdoor (or indoor if you like) bath.

The photo was taken on the New Year‚Äôs day of 2018.
It‚Äôs located slightly in a remote area, in the mountain north of the city. The way to the shrine is also so peaceful and quiet and I love the atmosphere in the area.

You must definitely buy the mizu omikuji here which is unique, unlike the usual omikujis. There are 3 gates, if i'm not mistaken, and the gate nearest to the train station is where they sell the omikuji. It may be difficult for elderly and as you have to climb up so many stairs, but for tourists or backpackers, it is a must go! Definitely coming back here again!

Gary Collins,2019-04-19 09:21:55,4,0,"KIFUNE JINJA SHRINE
Kifune (close to Kurama)

A SPECIAL ANCIENT SHRINE

As we were walking through the village of Hifune we noticed a lovely stairway going up to the shrine on both sides which is very picturesque and makes you feel like your in a tail from ancient Japanese story.

The shrine itself is obviously an important symbol for the village so please ensure you show the same respect for the shrine as the locals do and not like typical tourists pushing locals out of the way to take a snapshot which we regularly see.

Enjoy the peace and tranquility the shrine offers spending time to contemplate and summarise your visit to Kifune.

Recommendations
If your in Kifune take a moment to see the shrine, its quite relaxing and offers a break on your route back to the station.

They really have a lot of red lanterns which make a nice picture. On the way to the shrine are a few more expensive restaurants located down on the river. You're sitting over the running water, cause of that it's a naturally cool place.

There are restrooms and vending machines on the way up so it was not a problem that it took about 30 minutes to walk.

The most popular spot is the photogenic walkway to the shrine and not the shrine itself. There's a huge moss covered tree at the entrance torri gate too which is nice too. The lamps are usually lit up by evening to 8pm though do check the seasonal timings if you want to be there during the lit up.

There are multiple options to access Kifune with a bus running til late.

I will recommend accessing it via the Kurama Temple route, going up with the cable car (last ride at 16:20) and traverse through the forest walkway which is a delight in itself as you will pass by some unique looking trees. We even spotted deers roaming the forest! At Kifune, you can opt to walk back down to the train station (20-25mins walk), or wait for a bus ride down (170yen per adult).

This circuit can be done in the reverse too, just note that the last cable car down is at 16:25.

Romie Asplund,2023-05-08 16:52:06,5,2,"It has been a dream of mine to visit this shrine. Besides the pure beauty of this Shinto fantasy, cradled in dewy, verdant boughs of the sublime, Kifune Shrine is home to the ‚Äúema,‚Äù or Japanese wooden votive plaques. E(Áµµ) means picture, and ma(È¶¨) means horse, which is what those horse statues and horse-emblazoned plaques are all about. This shrine requires a bit of walking (nothing serious for non-Americans) and going up and down stairs. Do make sure you complete the course and reach the final shrine! It‚Äôs worth it. These shrines are incredibly clean and well-maintained. Best to visit during the morning before the tourists come surging in or around sunset once the lanterns come to life.

We went during April, which may just be the perfect time of year to make pilgrimage. The trees had been reclothed in their green plumage, the air temperate from infinitesimal  droplets of spring showers, and white-pink cherry blossom petals raining from the sky like snow. A transformative experience indeed.

A tip for the non-Japanese visitor: eschew the centers of the walkways, which are reserved for ‚Äúgod.‚Äù Do pay respects to the deities by kissing your palms together as you offer a brief bow of salutation before entering and after exiting an archway (torii).

Cheng Guan Luck,2023-05-13 14:13:22,5,2,"It was a great hike from Kurama station through the mountains (visited Kurama temple) and reached the other end which led to Kifune shrine. It took my wife and I about 2 hours for the whole trip.

Highly recommend this place to be visited during spring or autumn. However, I was not disappointed even though my visit was during summer time.

Quick tip:
You can do either way for the hike.
1. Kifune shrine ‚Üí Kurama station
2. Kurama station ‚Üí Kifune shrine

P.S. You could also visit these places by car as well. They also provide cable car and bus services (additional charge).

Leslie Lee,2023-05-23 03:25:23,4,2,"The journey from Kyoto Station to the shrine via public transport took me approximately 1.5 hours, which was longer than anticipated. After reaching the bus terminal point, there was an uphill walk of about 5 minutes before reaching the foot of the shrine. Thankfully, during my visit on a Sunday morning, the area was not crowded, allowing me to explore the shrine peacefully.

However, I must admit that considering the travel time and effort, this particular shrine may not be worth visiting if you have limited time in Kyoto. Unless you plan to stay in Kyoto for an extended period, it might be more prudent to prioritise other attractions that offer a more immersive experience within a shorter distance from the city center.

We'll, difficult when you wanna take a clean shot without any other people on it. It took me a while but there it is!

Restaurants around are expensive.
