Luke Phang,2017-04-10 13:29:12,4,0,"One of the reasons why I liked Kenninji was because of its historical value. One of the oldest temples in Kyoto, the place manages to successfully blend garden and building together, where you get to roam the wooden halls of the place while admiring the garden outside. There is also a giant painting of a tiger on the roof of one of the temples.

The last thing is just amazing, never saw that in Japan before. So there are very beautiful gardens inside, lots of nice paintings.. The place is especially nice when it's raining.

Baron Migs,2017-12-12 00:10:56,4,1,"Kennin-ji is the oldest Zen temple in japan. Walking in there is a wonderful and long pathway around the temple grounds. This helps you get some really good pictures in. Afterwards for a small admission feee you can enter the amazingly decorated temple. Come during the spring to see the cherry blossoms or during the fall when the trees are a vibrant shade of yellows to oranges. This stop on your kyoto trip should take more then 1-2 hours to get the full experience

Plan to take your time and spend a while here as the crowds pass through. There are multiple seating options so you can stop and take a breath. It’s only ¥600 adult entry and you take your shoes off at the entrance. You can use free red slipper to pass between the two buildings. Small gift shop at the end where a lady was giving out free samples of green tea.

It’s hard to put such a striking and beautiful place into words! Go see and experience for yourself :)
