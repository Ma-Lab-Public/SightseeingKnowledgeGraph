Vas,2015-11-17 01:09:04,4,2,"If you're a tourist looking to explore a religiously and traditionally significant Japanese location without too many other foreign tourists, Enryakuji is a pretty decent bet. For the full experience I would recommend taking the cable car if at all possible. You get and awesome view of Kobe on your way up and some nice views of the mountain to boot.",no,,view review
Martin Reindl,2015-12-10 07:24:44,5,2,"The Enryakuji temple complex on Mount Hiei is a wonderful day trip destination from Kyoto. The complex houses multiple temples from several schools of Buddhism. I came here because I'd heard about the marathon monks of the Tendai school, which is centered here. Generally speaking these temples are a bit more dark and heavy than temples generally are in Kyoto, which was a nice change. Hiking up the mountain took about 3 hours at a very brisk pace after which I explored for 2 hours and took the cable car down. I definitely recommend going here if you want a change of scenery and are feeling like a good hike.",no,,view review
Erik Visser,2016-06-15 03:01:48,4,2,"Hiking up to and down from the the monastery complex was wonderful. The temples there however were nice, but not awe inspiring. Nicely quiet though. Toilets were awful. Going up or down the mountain via cable cart will set you back about 10 bucks.",no,,view review
Paradise Walker,2017-02-13 21:22:42,5,2,"Amazing temple which has been designated as a ""World Cultural Heritage Site.""   The original temple was founded by Saicho(767-822) in 788.  The current temple building was rebuilt during Edo era, but its main Buddha image has been continuously illuminated by the candle light for over 1200 years.  No photo taking inside the temple but there are tons of sights for taking pictures in Mt. Hiei.

Steven Lee,2017-03-16 07:33:08,5,2,"I can say that this building is the biggest building in the complex, also probably the most important one.
Too bad, it was being renovated at the time I came there, so the outer part is covered by scaffolding, however you can still enter the building.
There's written english pamphlet given at the administration entrance.",no,,view review
J. B.,2017-07-20 01:50:46,4,3,"Vast temple complex on top of Mount Hiei, spread over three sites.  It is accessible by bus (1 hour from Kyoto Sanjo) or by cable car. It is historically important as one of the oldest Buddhist temples in Japan, the head of the Tendai school of Buddhism, and the scene of an important battle during the Sengoku period. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage site. However the buildings are not that impressive and may not be worth the trouble to get all the way there, unless you have plenty of time or you are a Japanese history buff.",no,,view review

Bad traffic system. There are two different cable lines, kensai thru pass can only apply one of them, if you took wrong line you will spend quite fee.

Bus service ends around 16:00, japanese language only.
One cable line service end at 17:30 which station located in temple area (fee required).
Temple closed at 16:30.

Xiao Fu,2018-09-12 11:04:05,5,2,"This is the name for the main monastery of tiantai tradition to develop in Japan, originated from China.

In one of the main temples, they kept the lamp burning already over thousand of years.

Has clear educational system for those who would dedicate themselves to Buddhism and this tradition.

The theoretical part learning and practice are all maintained from the very beginning.

Tantric session is also very important to Japanese Buddhism. Although tiantai tradition per se shall be a sect without too much tantric content, but the founder saw the tantric Buddhism was popular at that time, so he also made effort to introduce it into its own tradition.

Ben Hsu,2018-10-20 10:33:06,4,3,"Although the temple is a world cultural heritage site, as of October 2018, it is under renovation for its main temple, Konpon Chu-do; thus, visitors may not see much for historical part of the temple.

Like Miidera Temple, Enryakuji temple has good view of Biwako lake.

Because both shuttle bus and Fuku cable car service to the temple site end at about 0530pm, depending on season.  It is better for tourists to plan morning or lunch visit time.  Round-trip cable car service is operated every 30 minutes and crowded in weekend or holiday, and it costs 1,620 yen per adult.

Foreign visitors can take Keihan train service to Otsu and change Keihan Enryakuji line, walk about 10 minutes and then take cable car service to the temple.
