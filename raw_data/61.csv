Hartmut “habu” Wöhlbier,2013-08-02 05:52:12,5,0,My favorite temple in Kyoto with a beautiful garden! Maybe not as spectacular as others but very quit and lovely.,no,,view review
Benoît Jégou,2015-04-07 13:57:13,5,0,"A real great temple to visit!
It definitely worth the ¥500. First of all, it's a very calm temple quite aside from all the usual crowd you have in Kyoto. It let you be in a very nice atmosphere to relax and enjoy the place. Some stay here just to draw the garden.
The garden itself is really nice! He's quite small compare to others but everything is at the right place. You feel like you want to stay there forever.
Don't hesitate to go everywhere in the temple. Some rooms are kind of hidden, and once you're there, you feel like being alone in this small heaven... :)",no,,view review

Michael Armentano,2016-01-05 04:20:35,5,0,"Kyoto in many ways is actually busier than Tokyo. This is especially true of the more famous shrines,  which are absolutely amazing, but completely mobbed with people.  I think there are more people at the Inari shrine than at Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo for example.  Same is true for the Golden Pavilion.

Shoren-in however is (strangely) practically empty and unbelievably beautiful.  You pay 500 yen and can walk through the monestary.  There were monks chanting when we were there. The gardens and trees are all amazing and there is a beautiful bamboo Grove.

After a 5 day trip in kyoto, and after seeing many temples and shrines, this one was my favorite.   This was the only one where I could really focus on the beauty of the place and imagine what it would be like to be a monk here.",no,,view review

Kyoto Dream Trips,2017-09-29 03:10:34,5,2,"Situated at the base of Mount Awata and in the heart of the Kyoto City you’ll find the tranquil temple of Shōren-in (青蓮院). Once, after the Great Kyoto Fire of 1788, it was used as a temporary Imperial Palace.
The gardens inside Shōren-in are especially beautiful and the Ryūjin-no-ike pond (龍神池 or Heavenly Dragon Pond) is famous. The large rock in the middle of the pond looks like the back of a dragon, bathing in the pond.
There are two gardens, one the “Garden of Soami” designed by Sōami (相阿弥) in the Muromachi period (室町時代), and the “Kirishima Garden (霧島の庭)” designed by Kobori Enshū (小堀遠州).
Inside precincts of Shōren-in is a famous tea house (Kobun-tei - 好文亭) once used by Emperor Go-Sakuramachi (後桜町天皇) as a study.

We were recommended this temple by a young Japanese friend from Tokyo who said this was his favourite temple in Kyoto for all the reasons above. Without having seen all the temples ourselves, I would have to say he is right.

She circles some buildings on the map, telling us these are places we cannot take pictures. Also she tells us we cannot touch the slide door or window, which I also agree and understand. For all her requirements ""dont do this... dont do that..."", I relied with ""okay, no problem"". Okay, now the highlight comes, she said ""do not stay in the temple over 30 minutes"".  Excuse me???  What kind of rule is this? Is this a rule for all visitors, or only for me and my mon?

Jelly Brain,2018-08-26 14:02:07,1,4,"We are not allowed to enter inside because we were wearing the Kimono (Japanese style costume). We firstly entered in front of the ticket office and say hello politely ( in Japanese), then we asked the guy (from the ticket window) politely for buying ticket to go visit inside.
But he shakes his head and said: Kimono are not allowed to go inside.
And we accepted and left sadly even we just walked so far to this place during the 35 degree weather outside, even we found no instructions considering this kind of “interdiction” on their officials website. But we also said “ thank you” then we left.
Then we are told (from a Japanese friend) that it is weird we can not be allowed to go inside, because once another friend did wear the Kimono to visit this place.
Then we go back to the place where we rent the Kimono costume, the shop keepers show us the pictures of their guest also wearing the Kimono in this place...
Now we would say: what the ?
Okay it doesn’t matter, but just wanna tell the foreigners tourists/visitors, if you are wearing Kimono, don’t waste time to walk to this place.

Vincenzo Strumbo,2018-10-31 12:47:44,5,0,"Wonderful temple far from the chaotic center of the city.
Inside the temple there's an ""indoor"" garden with a small pond full of fishes and most of the rooms can be entered or at least seen from outside.
There's a small watchtower on the hill near the temple that gives an incredible view of the city.
Fewer tourists than the other temples of Kyoto come to this temple and that's really a plus.

From 18:00, they have special night opening and illumination during this Sakura season.
I entered at 18:00, it was still not dark so I could enjoy inside of the temples and garden.
The garden is huge and has variety of spots to see. Sakura trees, pond, carps, teahouse, bamboo forest and a small shrine on the hill.
Walking along, I felt like I was wandering in a different world.
In one hour, it got dark enough to enjoy night illumination.
I was fully satisfied to see this place both under sunlight and in darkness.

Shingo Sae-Lim,2021-12-01 15:10:56,5,1,"(Trip was made back then on 1 Dec 2019, 2 years before the Covid-19 Pandemic hit)

Shorenin Temple is a Tendai sect of Japanese Buddhism and is one of 5 monzeki(Japanese Buddhist priests of imperial lineage) temples in Kyoto city.

It was first constructed as a residence for Emperor Toba’s son to study Buddhism under Enryakuji-Jo’s head priest. The son eventually became the head priest of the temple, starting the tradition of a member of the imperial family serving as abbot of Shoren-in.

Seeing how overcrowded Kyoto is with tourists, I’’m surprised and thankful that Shorenin has been able to stay relatively hidden. Otherwise, it would have ruined the peace and serenity of the place.

The highlight for me was the Kadochan drawing room, with it’s own unique features, overlooks a beautiful garden where visitors could admire while sitting on tatami mats.
The garden itself is quite big and there’s even a bamboo forest simulating the Arashiyama feeling.

Shorenin temple may be one of the lesser known attractions in Kyoto, but during autumn season, it’s known for it’s night illumination event where Shinden garden is illuminated with blue light, transforming it into a otherworldly mystical realm. Numerous blue light orbs glow and dim against the darkness, portraying an almost magical feeling.

It was definitely one of the most memorable highlights during our stay in Kyoto 2 years ago and would love to revisit the next chance I get.

In the entrance, you pay 500 Yen where you will be presented with a brief history of the place and traditional candies in a very cute can 😊 Since the floors are tatami, you will be asked to take off your shoes. There is a locker for your convenience. While walking in the historical corners of the building, you will be amazed every second. It was very peaceful and poetic. l strongly recommend a visit here.

Michael Ting,2023-05-28 11:38:51,5,1,"One of the best and most important (low key) Japanese gardens in Kyoto. Favorites by the royal family, this garden has a special significance in Japanese Buddhism. When we visited, abbots from outside Kyoto were visiting by the literal busloads. Had a very pleasant conversation with a couple of he abbots who were excitedly taking pictures of the gardens. Some where simply sitting down to take it all in. Great experience and a lot less crowded compared to the other gardens in Kyoto.
